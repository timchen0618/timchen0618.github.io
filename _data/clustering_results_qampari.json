The shot has since been used in many other films, including \"Goodfellas\", \"Jaws\", and the \"Lord of the Rings\" films. Rainer Werner Fassbinder uses the effect twice in one shot in \"Chinese Roulette\" (1976). The dolly zoom is commonly used by filmmakers to represent the sensation of vertigo, a \"falling-away-from-oneself feeling\" or a feeling of unreality, or to suggest that a character is undergoing a realization that causes them to reassess everything they had previously believed.",

Multiple camera rigs were used. Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production. DNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to manage the shoot; it was the first time Mantle had worked with 3D. The filmmakers wanted \"Dredd\" to have a realistic, visceral look, and drew inspiration from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting. Mega-City One and its high rise towers were created in Cape Town Film Studios.",

There were reportedly more than a dozen edited versions of the film at one time fighting to be the final cut, the longest version being over four hours. The disputes during post-production lasted for over a year before a final version was settled upon. Over an hour of scenes were deleted for the theatrical version, but Dominik remarked he was still very proud of the theatrical version of the film. The film garnered two Academy Award nominations: Best Cinematography (Deakins) and Best Supporting Actor (Affleck).",

The Hashima model was included after Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad while shooting \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short 2002 documentary on the island entitled \"Hashima\", recalled Craig taking extensive notes during the meeting, but was unaware of his interest in it until \"Skyfall\" was released. The film was later converted into the IMAX format for projection in IMAX cinemas.",

In 2015, Nabil produced his second video, \"I Saved My Belly Dancer\", with actors Salma Hayek and Tahar Rahim, a narration around his fascination with the tradition of belly dancers and the disappearance of the art form that is unique to the Middle East. The 12-minute video also explores shifting perceptions of women in the Arab world and the tensions between the amplified sexualisation of their bodies and the continued repression of women in modern Arab society.",

Herzog's original cut was 60 minutes long, but it was edited down to 45 minutes to fit in a one-hour television spot.

Fassbinder plays the lead role of Franz, a small-time pimp who is torn between his mistress Joanna, a prostitute played by Hanna Schygulla, and his friend Bruno, a gangster sent after Franz by the syndicate that he has refused to join. Joanna informs the police of a bank robbery the two men have planned. Bruno is killed in the shootout, but Franz and Joanna escape.",

The crew smoothed out the road themselves to prepare the shots. Herzog and the crew encountered many problems during the filming. In Cameroon they were imprisoned because cameraman Schmidt-Reitwein's name was similar to the name of a German mercenary who was hiding from the authorities and had recently been sentenced to death \"in absentia\".

Hyams followed with \"The Musketeer\" (2001), a new version of the famous novel by Alexandre Dumas, which was a minor box office success. However, his next film, \"A Sound of Thunder\" (2005), a science-fiction movie, had serious difficulties during its production (including the bankruptcy of the original production company during post-production), performed particularly badly at the box office worldwide and was poorly received by critics. He directed an episode of the series \"Threshold\" (2005).",
