Preference is given to fluid hydration, swelling and its complications, establishing and maintaining an airway, nutritional supplements, a catheter for monitoring urine output, X-rays and possible skin grafts. Burns damage the skin, which protects the body from fluid loss and infection, and can result in renal failure, life-threatening infections, shock and death. Fluid loss alters the balance of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium and water, requiring constant replacement and monitoring. Types of Burns Burns result from exposure to heat from fire or liquids, electricity, chemicals and radiation. Categories of burns are first-degree, second-degree and third-degree. First-degree burns damage the epidermis or outer layer of tissue and result in redness and pain. Second-degree burns damage epidermal and dermal tissue, the second layer of skin, and result in redness, pain and blisters. Third-degree burns damage skin down to the nerves, muscles, tendons and possibly bones, leaving a charred appearance with no pain as a result of nerve damage.

First-degree burns have good capillary refill and do not represent significant injury in terms of fluid replacement needs. ## Second Degree Second-degree burns represent a partial-thickness injury to the dermis, which may be either superficial or deep. Deep second-degree burns heal much more slowly than first-degree burns and are prone to developing infection. The end result of second-degree burns may be hypertrophic scarring. ## Third Degree In third-degree burns, the dermal barrier is lost, and the presence of necrotic tissue creates fluid volume loss with systemic effects on capillaries well away from the burn site. In addition, the burn site establishes an ideal culture medium for infection, which may be life threatening. Blood supply is the critical factor in healing of third-degree burns. Areas rich in blood supply, such as hair follicles and sweat glands, have a better chance for reepithelialization.

Thermal Burns \u2014 These burns involve contact with hot objects, fire, hot liquid, or steam. Chemical Burns \u2014 Also referred to as alkali burns, these occur as a result of contact with acidic substances. Electrical Burns \u2014 Contact with an electrical current causes these types of burns. Radiation Burns \u2014 These burns are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, or thermal radiation. Friction Burns \u2014 These types of burns involve skin rubbing against a rough surface. First-Degree Burns \u2014 Superficial burn involving only the epidermis (outer layer of the skin). The most common example of a first-degree burn is sunburn. Most first-degree burn injuries usually heal in a few days. Second-Degree Burns \u2014 A second-degree burn involves damage to the epidermis as well as the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis. Blistering could result and some second-degree burns can involve skin grafts, a procedure where skin is transplanted from another area of the body. Third-Degree Burns \u2014 A full thickness burn in which both layers of skin are damaged or destroyed with damage extending into sweat glands and underlying tissue. Third-degree burns always require skin grafting, but additional surgery could also be required. Additional classifications are used for other burn injuries that are often far more catastrophic.

Second-degree deep burns are generally white and dry and can cause scarring. Third Degree Burn Third-degree burns are the most serious and can cause death or permanent scarring, disfigurements, and disabilities. These burns are deep enough to damage muscles and other soft tissues under the dermis layer of the skin. They may appear charred or leather-like, and may be black, brown, red, or yellow. Due to the number of nerve endings that are damaged, the third-degree burns are sometimes not as painful immediately as more superficial burns. Fourth Degree Burn Fourth-degree burns are the most life-threatening and generally go deep enough to damage the bone. In these cases, the skin cannot be recovered, and the burned arms or legs are amputated. Obviously, the highest results are for damage incurred by third and fourth-degree burns. In addition to fires, burns can occur as a result of hot liquids or scalds. There was a famous case of personal injury of a woman who was burned for coffee at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. For this reason, from a legal rather than a medical point of view, burns are also classified by their origin: Minor burns are the result of some kind of light, such as sunlight, tanning bed, etc. Chemical burns come from exposition of dangerous substances. Radiation burns come from exposition of some type of radiation, such as nuclear.

A first-degree, or superficial, burn, although painful, causes only minor skin damage, usually heals in 3 to 5 days, and leaves no scar. Skin with a first-degree (superficial) burn is dry with no blisters. Sunburn or a minor scald is an example of a first-degree (superficial) burn.

The skin is moist, wet and weepy, with blisters present. It is swollen and bright pink to cherry red in color. A third-degree, or full thickness, burn, the most severe, destroys all three layers of skin, and can involve fat, muscle, and bone. Skin grafts are required to treat this kind of burn.

If the direction is bent enough, the light that passes through the object will be angled out of the forward-traveling beam. As a result, the beam will have a dark spot; a shadow. Consider completely transparent objects such as glass cups, bottles of water, or the lenses of eyeglasses. Even though such transparent objects do not absorb or reflect very much light, they still interact with light through refraction. Refraction is what makes transparent cups visible to our eyes. Refraction also enables clear objects to cast shadows. Take off your eyeglasses and place them on the table at night under the illumination of a single lamp and you will see a distinct shadow caused by the transparent lenses. Although air is almost perfectly transparent, it can still cast shadows via refraction. The key principle regarding refraction is that light is bent when the index of refraction differs from one location to the next. Air and glass are different materials and have different indices of refraction. Light therefore bends when it goes from air into glass, such as at the surface of a glass lens. Refraction does not happen inside a glass lens because the material inside the lens is uniform. Refraction happens at the surface of a glass lens because that is the only place where the index of refraction differs. Uniform air itself cannot refract light and create shadows because the index of refraction does not differ anywhere. But,"}, {"title": "Document 6", "text": "heck noticed that?

Its with some trepidation that Im starting this section of my blog, because I really dont understand physics very well. Most of it, I suspect, will be about how little I understand. But Im going to give it a whirl. Sometime this summer it occurred to me that the phenomenon of transparency is more more complex than one might initially think, and more so than most people realize. I went around asking people with more physics education than I had if they could explain to me why things like glass and water are transparent, and it seemed to me that not only did they not understand it any better than I did, but they didnt realize that they didnt understand it. A common response, for example, was that media like glass and water are transparent because the light passes through them unimpeded. This is clearly wrong. We can see that its wrong because both glass and water have a tendency to refract incident light. Unimpeded photons always travel in straight lines. If light is refracted by a medium, it is because the photons couple with electrons in the medium, are absorbed, and then new photons are emitted"}, {"title": "Document 7", "text": "to its visibility.

Probably more because there will be a little tiny bit of smoke, but not much more. A: We usually see shadows thrown by buildings and people walking around in streets on a bright sunlit day. Obviously, what is happening here, is that light is being blocked from travelling by matter in its line of flight and this gives a shadow. Not all matter will do. For example, a window is made up of matter but it is transparent to light and let light through and we see no shadow thrown by a window. Air, too, is made up of matter, but it is transparent to light and we see no shadows thrown by air too. A lighter flame is is essentially hot gas and like air is transparent to light. However, unlike air, it is giving off light as it combusts and so - rather than throwing a shadow - it throws up a spot of light on a sheet of paper held close to it, even in a sunny day.

But I want to know, if an incoming photon is unable to excite an electron, then why not all the photons pass through glass? i.e. photons should not reflect off glass, all the photons should pass through glass. (Not sure! Just a thought)Is this due to atoms of different substances like water,glass or wood etc curve spacetime differently and thus it influences how photons interact with matter? i.e. some photons reflect and some refract. In classical electrodynamics, the process of how much light refracts, passing through the glass, and how much light reflects, is determined by the Huygens-Fresnel principle. This principle, named after Christiaan Huygens and Augustin-Jean Fresnel, is a method of analyzing the wave propagation patterns of light, especially in diffraction and refraction. It states that every unobstructed point on a wave-front emanates secondary spherical waves in all directions. Hence, the net light amplitude at a given point is the vector sum of all wave amplitudes at that point. This principle makes it very useful in visualizing what happens during light diffraction.

But how can a piece of glass do this? The process is actually very simple. As light travels from one medium to another, it changes speed. Light travels more quickly through air than it does through glass, so a lens slows it down. When light waves enter a piece of glass at an angle, one part of the wave will reach the glass before another and so will start slowing down first. This is something like pushing a shopping cart from pavement to grass, at an angle. The right wheel hits the grass first and so slows down while the left wheel is still on the pavement. Because the left wheel is briefly moving more quickly than the right wheel, the shopping cart turns to the right as it moves onto the grass. The effect on light is the same -- as it enters the glass at an angle, it bends in one direction. It bends again when it exits the glass because parts of the light wave enter the air and speed up before other parts of the wave. In a standard converging, or convex lens, one or both sides of the glass curves out. This means rays of light passing through will bend toward the center of the lens on entry.

Cards fit into the wallet easily: It is essential that we need to have some sort of money in hand always as we never know when a need arises. But carrying a lot of cash in hand is not at all a wise idea. Also, who would want to carry a lot of cash in hand and make their wallet bulge out. In such situations, plastic money comes for help. Your wallet will remain perfect and your cash needs will also be sorted out. If required you can take cash using plastic cards.

Plastic money is rapidly becoming one of the most widely used forms of payment platforms. But what is plastic money? There are essentially two different types of cards that can be classified as plastic money \u2013 a debit card and a credit card. In this article we will talk about the different forms of debit cards and the reasons behind it becoming one of the most popular types of plastic money available in the market today. A credit card essentially helps you to take money on credit and you need to pay back the money when the financial institution raises a bill. But in case of the debit card, you are making an immediate payment and hence no terms of credit are involved in it. Before we go into the details as why you should opt for a debit card, we need to understand the basic functions of it. A debit card is linked to the bank account you have with the financial institution or bank. When you are getting a debit card, you are actually getting a pass to use the balance in your account without having to go to the bank each time or signing a cheque each time you make a payment. When you are swiping your debit card, you are essentially taking out money from your bank through that card.

Convenience of making payments from home: In olden days when there was no plastic money, we need to go personally to each place to make a payment be it utility payments or booking tickets. But now you can pay at your own convenience sitting at home with the use of plastic money. For example, you need to go to the travel agency to pay cash for your ticket, instead, you can book your ticket online. Also when a travel agency is involved, they charge commission or fee but when you are booking the ticket directly from the airlines website, you are saving on it. Plastic cards can also be used for online purchases. We can see many online shops coming up these days. If you find something interesting on a website and would want to have it, you can always purchase it anytime using plastic money.

Plastic cards are typically manufactured using a polymeric material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or styrene. These materials provide the desired properties and characteristics of the plastic cards, such as, for example, rigidity, durability, and price. For example, credit cards must meet certain ISO standards, such as, for example, ISO/IEC 7810:2003 entitled \u201cIdentification Cards\u2014Physical Characteristics,\u201d ISO/IEC 7813:2001 entitled \u201cIdentification Cards\u2014Financial transaction cards\u201d and ISO/IEC 7816.1:1987(E) entitled \u201cIdentification Cards\u2014Integrated circuit(s) cards with contacts,\u201d both of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, materials such as PVC and styrene are perceived as being not environmentally friendly in that they do not biodegrade readily and cannot easily be recycled because there is no established recycling stream. PVC, for example, raises environmental concerns with the use of vinyl chloride, phthalate plasticizers, and dioxin when such material is burned. Furthermore, PVC and polystyrene are made from either crude oil or natural gas, and can therefore be subject to price fluctuations of oil, and depend on foreign oil supplies. Recently, there has been a trend to adopt \u201cgreen\u201d materials, products, and practices. Green materials are materials that have a lesser impact on the environment in a variety of ways including reducing the amount of material used, reusing or recycling the material, using material that is renewable, is biodegradable, is biocompostable, is sustainable, is inert in a landfill environment, contains no toxins in its manufacture, is locally produced, and/or leaves a lower carbon footprint.

Cardboard based substrates are seen as preferable to plastics for environmental reasons From a production cost perspective, plastics are usually more expensive to produce, and in certain cases the static contained in the material leads to difficulties when printing the base stock and therefore costly wastage. Plastic is also bulkier and heavier in many cases and this has a significant effect on transportation costs, particularly concerning air freight, where weight and cubic calculations come into play when assessing shipping costs.

Some believe that simply using plastic for transactions makes us spend more, because it changes how our brains work -- or, at least, how we think -- when were making purchases. However, their case is far from conclusive. A couple of years ago, IndexCreditCards.com reviewed some of the academic research thats tried to explore the supposed link between credit card use and greater spending. Its undeniable that a number of studies suggest such a link, and at least one (Do Payment Mechanisms Change the Way Consumers Perceive Products? from the Journal of Consumer Research) found that people who made purchases using plastic might tend to focus more on a products benefits, while those paying cash tend to focus more on its cost. However, the problem with many of these studies was highlighted in another paper, published in 2009 by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University: Its easy to show a correlation between card use and higher spending, but much harder to demonstrate causation.

When he mentioned his problem to his wife, who happened to be ironing clothing at the time, she suggested that he use the iron to essentially melt the strip on. And that\u2019s what he did. IBM became a pioneer in magnetic stripe technology. The story of the magnetic stripe isn\u2019t just about the ingenuity of the technology. Even more important was the effort by IBM and other leaders of electronic payments to create open compatibility standards. Working with the banking and airlines industries, IBM helped develop the approach that was adopted as a U.S. standard in 1969 and an international standard two years later. That meant that anybody could use their magnetic stripe credit or debit card anywhere in the world. It also meant that IBM couldn\u2019t benefit directly from its magnetic stripe inventions. \u201cWe decided not to patent the stripe or the stripe production technologies.

But it turns out that there is more to it than that. A new paper from Tamas Briglevics and Oz Shy from the Boston Fed strongly suggests that offering a cash and, especially, a debit card discount may not even make financial sense for the merchants themselves. Let\u2019s see why. Consider a merchant selling to consumers who spend on average $30 for each transaction. Suppose that the merchant fee on credit card transactions is 2 percent (hence, 60?\u00f3 per average transaction). Suppose that the merchant fee on debit cards is a flat 25?\u00f3 per transaction. Note that the debit card fee does not vary with the value of the transaction. Footnote 10 explains why 25?\u00f3 is a realistic estimate of a debit card merchant fee. Conjecture 1. Because 60?\u00f3 > 25?\u00f3, profit is always enhanced when merchants steer the average customer to pay with debit cards instead of paying with credit cards. Suppose that the 1-percent debit card discount is a sufficient incentive to induce all customers who pay with credit cards to switch to paying with debit cards. Then, the merchant saves 60?\u00f3, which is the credit card merchant fee on a $30 transaction. On the other hand, each consumer who switches from paying with credit to paying with debit increases the merchant cost by 25?\u00f3 per transaction. In addition, the merchant loses 1 percent from the debit card price, which equals 0.01"}, {"title": "Document 57", "text": "Mobile/ Report/ Plastc wants to replace your entire wallet with a single card ...but have we already left cards behind? By Ellis Hamburger Source Plastc Oct 7, 2014, 1:00 PM UTC | How much technology can you fit into a 0.8-millimeter-thick credit card? Last November, Coin offered a first taste of what was possible. The device promised to digitally hold eight credit or debit cards and let you choose between them at will. You could swipe Coin in any conventional card reader, and it would notify you if it had been lost or stolen using Bluetooth. Coin would have a two-year battery life, and a companion app that could hold your coupons and ID cards. But Coin still hasn\u2019t shipped. Today, we\u2019re getting a second take at the card tech category with Plastc, which manages to bundle twice as many features into the same svelte form factor. Like Coin, Plastc syncs with your phone using Bluetooth. It lets you swipe between 20 cards or barcodes using an E-ink touchscreen, and offers NFC (like the iPhone 6) for contactless transactions, an EMV chip for the latest card readers, and RFID so you can replace your office building\u2019s ID card. Even if you don\u2019t know all the acronyms by heart, Plastc already sounds impressive. But there\u2019s more. You can put your wallet on top of an included charging mat to charge up Plastc overnight. (But if you don\u2019t, it lasts 30 days on a charge.)

As soon as you know that you are pickpocketed, you can call the bank and ask them to block or cancel the card. If it was actual cash in its place, then it is easy for the thief. He can easily take the cash and throw the wallet somewhere. But with plastic money, his job has become a difficult one. He needs to know cracking techniques to find the PIN number to use the cards. Hence worries associated with theft will be less in case of plastic money. Another merit is that the fingerprints on a plastic card are more clear than that on bank notes.

With the advent of credit cards you can purchase anything today and you are given sufficient time to pay for it. Only with plastic money, you avail this credit facility. The advantage of having this facility is that you need not go behind people to borrow money in case of emergencies, instead, you can use the card in your hand.

You\u2019ll still insert your card into a reader (which is just slightly different than swiping it through). Next, the machine and the card exchange information to confirm the card and the information it generates is authentic and not fraudulent. Once confirmed, you enter your PIN and complete your transaction. Why Is This More Secure? You need to understand how older credit cards worked to know why chip-and-PIN is considered \u201cmore secure\u201d than previous credit cards. In the past, the only security feature built into a credit card was the magnetic strip on the back. This strip contained information about your line of credit, and it\u2019s what a machine read when you swiped your card at a cash register or through an ATM. The information stored on the strip was tied to your account and is what determined whether or not your payment was accepted. Here\u2019s the thing: this technology is the same used in cassette tapes. But we\u2019re talking about our credit cards and financial information here. You can see why this just wasn\u2019t secure enough to prevent issues like fraud. Stealing data from credit cards with just the magnetic strip is easy for thieves to do. The information is static, it\u2019s not encrypted, and it\u2019s easy to read. People committing fraud could easily take the information -- either with a credit card skimmer or by taking the card out of sight and copying down the number and security code -- and use it to make purchases or even counterfeit copies of the card.

In the epic poem The Odyssey, Odysseus and his men have to travel through the Straits of Messina, an area of the sea guarded by two fearsome monsters: Scylla, a monster with six mouths and 12 feet, and Charybdis, either a sea monster who produced a whirlpool or simply a whirlpool itself. Opting for either one was sure to result in death, for at least some of the crew, so the phrase \u201cbetween Scylla and Charybdis\u201d came to mean having to choose the lesser of two evils. 4 Bust One\u2019s Chops Today\u2019s meaning: Call one\u2019s bluff; criticize someone In the 1800s, when sideburns (and Ambrose Burnside) were at the height of their popularity, this phrase was often used as a challenge to someone\u2019s integrity. The phrase fell out of popular usage around the start of World War I, as men needed to shave the sides of their faces in order to accommodate protective gas masks. As a phrase, it was not only to be taken figuratively, \u201cbust one\u2019s chop\u201d was also to be taken literally. A \u201cbust to one\u2019s chops\u201d could reference a punch to the side of one\u2019s face. Thanks to the popularity of sideburns between the 1950s and the 1970s, and men like Lemmy, the phrase made a brief comeback before fading into relative obscurity today. 3 Give The Cold Shoulder Today\u2019s meaning: To disregard someone Although its true origins are unclear, the earliest written evidence of this phrase comes from the writings of Walter Scott, a Scottish poet and novelist"}, {"title": "Document 20", "text": "slang words have this meaning?

In the sense of failing (especially financially) it is informal, as busting the bank in gambling lingo, while in the specialized sense of taming a horse it is standard, the only way to say busting a bronco.\u201d Despite its potential slanginess, busted is \u201cnot actually forbidden\u201d in the news media, as the Boston Globe language columnist Jan Freeman wrote in August. Indeed, reporters often latch onto the occasional colloquialism that seems particularly expressive, and in this case, Freeman surmises they were drawn to the term\u2019s \u201ccriminal-cowboy-macho connotations.\u201d Regardless of the reasons for its current vogue, it\u2019s notable that busted was rarely relied on by the press to describe stricken oil wells before the BP disaster \u2014 even in incidents that were highly similar, such as the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc I well in the Gulf of Mexico.

Bust a Bronco Meaning Definition: To tame a wild horse; to train a wild horse to be ridden. Origin of Bust a Bronco This expression first appeared in the late 1800s and comes from the American frontier. Bust comes from burst, which is a synonym for break. Breaking horses is another expression with the same meaning. Cowboys or other people living in the country would use this expression when training horses. They likely used this expression because training horses traditionally has involved breaking their spirit by trying to dominate them. If the horse fears humans, it will be more likely to allow them to ride it. Examples of Bust a Bronco In this example, two sisters talk about their upcoming vacation to a ranch in Colorado. Amy: I can\u2019t believe our parents are making us go to this ranch. Kimberly: Really? I\u2019m super excited for it! Amy: No way. You mean you want to throw lassos and bust a bronco?

The approach might also be applied to other hypersonic vehicles such as futuristic military planes and ballistic missiles. They discuss their approach in this week\u2019s Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing. Communication blackouts with hypersonic vehicles occur because as the craft zips along at five or more times the speed of sound, an envelope of hot ionized air, called a plasma sheath, surrounds it. This plasma sheath will reflect electromagnetic signals under most conditions, cutting off connection with anything outside of the vehicle. However, under certain special conditions, a plasma sheath can actually enhance the radiation from a communication antenna. Gao and his colleagues reasoned that it would be possible to replicate these special conditions in ordinary hypersonic flight by redesigning the antenna.

But the phenomenon could also affect communications with new aircraft and weapons systems being contemplated now by the U.S. Air Force, which hopes to find ways to pierce the blackout. The problem arises when a speeding vehicle heats the air in front of it, ionizing it into plasma that blocks radio transmissions. It resembles the shock waves created when an airplane hits Mach 1 and breaks the sound barrier. In the case of reentering spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft, the plasma-shock boundaries form at speeds of about Mach 10. The space shuttle avoids the blackout because the craft\u2019s broad underside leaves an open area in the plasma plume trailing behind, enabling communications and telemetry data to be relayed to Earth through a network of satellites. But smaller craft are completely engulfed by the plasma. That has concerned the air force, which plans to develop flight systems, perhaps including hypersonic missiles, surveillance craft and even manned craft that could top Mach 10. \u201cOur standard paradigm [in the test and evaluation world] is we have a vehicle in the air and people on the ground"}, {"title": "Document 6", "text": "including explosions on the sun, intense upper atmosphere winds, and dynamic electric field changes.

During most of its lifetime, C/NOFS never came closer than about 250 miles above the ground. However, as solar activity increased, C/NOFS began to orbit at lower and lower altitudes -- ultimately descending to less than 160 miles above Earth. During its last 13 months of operations, as its orbit decayed and it spiraled into lower altitudes and eventual re-entry into Earths atmosphere, C/NOFS satellite captured a unique set of comprehensive observations as it traveled through the very space environment that can directly cause premature orbital decay. Such regions have rarely been studied directly for extended periods of time, because orbits in this denser region of the atmosphere are not sustainable long-term without on board propulsion.

This is because at altitudes of higher density, there are more ions and subsequently more possibility for collisions, which are the cause of deionization. In the E and F layers, the density is low enough such that these collisions do not happen as often as in the D layer, meaning that these two layers remain ionized long after radiation has stopped being applied. In fact, they remain ionized throughout the entire night, whereas the D layer loses its ionization during the night. This property of the ionosphere is what allows for radio communication via sky waves. At the ion density of the E and F layers during both day and night, LF and VLF radio waves reflect off of the ions, propagating back down to the surface of the earth. However, the properties of the D layer provide some difficulties. During the day, the ion density is too high for some LF, and especially VLF, radio waves to pass through to then be reflected off of the E or F layers. Instead, the waves are absorbed by the ions.

The ionosphere and the ions present there tend to interfere with these signals. Changes in the ions, their density, and localization in the ionosphere will affect how satellites record data and communicate it. But the ionosphere is just invisible air, after all, right?

Changes in the characteristic photometric spectrum emitted by the ionosphere is how changes in the ionosphere are detected. The composition of the ionosphere is affected by the weather in space, as well as the weather conditions on Earth. The weather on Earth, the intensity of solar radiation, and gravity waves are some of the causes of changes in the ionosphere.

The advisories have a standard format. Radiation at flight level During solar storms, solar particles like protons can suddenly be accelerated, heading into space at great speed. When they arrive at Earth, these energetic particles can penetrate the atmosphere at the magnetic poles. They bombard atmospheric particles and create a shower of particles possibly reaching the Earth\u2019s surface. When this happens, crew and passengers onboard airplanes are more vulnerable to this harmful radiation. The effect is stronger at high altitudes and latitudes. The ionosphere plays also a crucial role in satellite navigation. The signal sent by the satellite has to pass through the ionosphere to reach the receiver. Solar storms can introduce small scale structures in the ionosphere. When the signal encounters these obstacles, its amplitude and phase can alter very rapidly. Similarly, when the number of electrons in the ionosphere increases dramatically due to a solar storm, positioning errors are introduced in satellite navigation. HF communication The ionosphere is a layer at the top of our atmosphere which is ionised due to sunlight (at ultraviolet and x-ray wavelengths). Because the layer is ionised, it has the ability to reflect HF radio waves allowing long distance radio communication, which is crucial for aviation.
