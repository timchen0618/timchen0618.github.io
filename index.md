I am a second-year Master's student in computer science at **the University of Texas at Austin**. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Eunsol Choi](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/). Prior to UT, I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. 

My research interest broadly lies in natural language processing and machine learning. More specifically, I am interesting in building system that can understand language and respond to human queries accurately.
