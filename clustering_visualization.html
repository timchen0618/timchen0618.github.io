On the other hand, keys registered with io.mapOptional() are allowed to not exist in the YAML document being read. So what value is put in the field for those optional keys? There are two steps to how those optional fields are filled in. First, the second parameter to the mapping() method is a reference to a native class. That native class must have a default constructor. Whatever value the default constructor initially sets for an optional field will be that fields value. Second, the mapOptional() method has an optional third parameter. If provided it is the value that mapOptional() should set that field to if the YAML document does not have that key. There is one important difference between those two ways (default constructor and third parameter to mapOptional). When YAML I/O generates a YAML document, if the mapOptional() third parameter is used, if the actual value being written is the same as (using ==) the default value, then that key/value is not written. Order of Keys -------------- When writing out a YAML document, the keys are written in the order that the calls to mapRequired()/mapOptional() are made in the mapping() method. This gives you a chance to write the fields in an order that a human reader of the YAML document would find natural. This may be different that the order of the fields in the native class.

Materialist The materialist school of mediatization theory is studying how society to an increasing degree becomes dependent on the media and their logic. The studies are combining results from different areas of science to describe how changes in the media and changes in society are interrelated. In particular, they are focusing on how the political processes in western democracies are changing through mediatization. The mediatization of politics can be characterized by four different dimensions, according to the Swedish professor of political communication Jesper Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck and the Swiss professor of media research Frank Esser: The first dimension refers to the degree to which the media constitute the most important source of information about politics and society. The second dimension refers to the degree to which the media have become independent from other political and social institutions. The third dimension refers to the degree to which media content and the coverage of politics and current affairs is guided by media logic rather than political logic. This dimension deals with the extent to which the media\u2019s own needs and standards of newsworthiness, rather than those of political actors or institutions, are decisive for what the media cover and how they cover it. The fourth dimension refers to the extent to which political institutions, organizations, and actors are guided by either media logic or political logic.

Therefore, the first ORF is what makes Grapevine virus A unique. The third ORF codes for putative movement protein. This protein ensures efficient cell to cell propagation (producing seeds). The fourth ORF codes for capsid protein (the hard shell that encases the genetic material).

This is the protein that helps the DNA or RNA connect with amino acids. Even further research of the genomes of GVA traced Grapevine virus A back to Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus. When the DNA of Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus was replicated there were mistakes, also known as mutations, made. The mutations created a new virus that was so different from the original virus, and this new virus eventually got the name Grapevine virus A.

In the Tests, Kippax passed fifty four times in seven innings, without going on to a hundred. He shared two big partnerships with Bradman: 192 in the second Test at Lords and 229 in the third Test at Leeds.

A beautiful driver to the off, he cut at times in delightful fashion, the slower wickets of England affecting his abilities in that direction in only the slightest degree.

These degrees include: First-degree \u2013 A minor first-degree burn injury only affects the skin\u2019s outer layer, like a mild sunburn, blister, or other heat exposure. Typically, victims with first-degree burns rarely have long-term damage to the affected area. Second-degree \u2013 A moderate second-degree burn injury typically damages the skins dermis (underlying) layers, appearing swollen, red, wet, or shiny. At this stage, the burn will likely blister and hurt when touched. Superficial second-degree burns typically damage the dermis layer and do not cause scarring. Deep partial-thickness second-degree burns are more severe, causing permanent skin color changes Third-degree \u2013 This full-thickness burn injury usually destroys the skin\u2019s two upper layers, causing the skin to appear yellow, white, brown, or black. Usually, third-degree burns have only minimal pain because the nerve endings have been damaged. Fourth-degree \u2013 Burn specialists identify fourth-degree burns as the most severe life-threatening burn, destroying every skin layer, and killing tissue, tendons, muscles, and bone. Fifth-degree \u2013 Typically, a fifth-degree burn injury surpasses fourth-degree burns when the ligaments and muscle layers have burned away, leaving charred bone, destroying skin and muscle, and loss of function. Every burn degree can worsen over time as the injury spreads. The injury can also cause significant complications, where joint and bone problems arise, or infection begins to develop. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), specific society segments are more at risk of suffering a burn injury than others. Contributing factors to a burn could include:"}, {"title": "Document 8", "text": "the seriousness of the burn on the skin; in other words, the severity of the damage, which the burn has one the skin. We have the First-Degree burn as the most minor, and the last one, the third-degree being the most severe. \u2022 First-Degree burn: a skin, which is nonblistered and red as well. \u2022 Second-Degree: you tend to experience the presence of blisters and a few thickening of the skin. \u2022 Third-Degree burn: a thickness, which is widespread; and this thickness has an appearance that\u2019s leathery and white. And to add to this, there exists fourth-degree burn, this type of burn has the whole symptoms of A third-degree burn, which means that it acts like the third-degree burn. But, the difference is, fourth-degree burn goes deep \u2014 beyond the skin \u2014 into bones as well as tendons. Burns consists of several causes, let\u2019s take a look at them. Know this, the cause of a burn doesn\u2019t determine the type of burn; what determines it is, how long that liquid or fire remains in contact with the skin. Looking at scalding, this very one can lead to the cause of the whole three degrees; want to know what it depends on? well, it depends on the level of hotness of the liquid and also, how long it touches the skin.

Brad Wiggens: Sure, yeah, I mean a third degree burn is a third degree burn. So a first degree burn would be a sunburn, a second degree burn would be when you get significant blistering from touching something hot, not blisters that you get from a sunburn, and a third degree burn would be burning all the way through all the layers of your skin, down past your dermal layers and down into subcutaneous tissues. So a third degree burn is a third degree burn no matter which way you got it. Whether it was from the glass front fireplace, whether it was from a heating pad, its pretty difficult to get to that point with a heating pad because of the heat they do put out, however, because its on an elderly person we see of danger with that, where you actually have such significant amount of damage, you have a deeper injury, they dont have the good circulation that they need to heal that injury, so it actually ends up being a deeper second to a third degree burn and lends itself to needing to have a skin graft, which lends itself to a hospital stay within our intensive care unit, and really longer outcomes.

As said earlier, the First-Degree burn affects the skin\u2019s top layer. Immediately the skin sheds, the signs, and symptoms go out. This type of burn heals in the space of 7-10 days, without leaving any scar. In this type of burn, the damage done doesn\u2019t just happen at the skin\u2019s surface, it goes beyond the surface, the top layer. And, that\u2019s why it\u2019s more serious than that of the First-Degree. The Second-Degree burn makes the skin to blister and ends up being sore and red. A few of these blisters pop open, making the burn to have an appearance that\u2019s wet. There\u2019s a tissue known as fibrinous exudate \u2014 as time goes on, this particular tissue will, probably, begin to take its place around, over the wound. The nature of this wound appears so delicate, so it\u2019s essential that you ensure that you keep the area, which you have the burn, clean. And also, bandage it in a proper manner \u2014 doing these helps you to stay away from infection. This also does well in helping the burn heal fastly. Yes, I have already talked a little about the fourth-degree burn, but let\u2019s keep it aside; Third-Degree burn happens to be the most severe and serious.

The Mayo Clinic explains that there are three degrees of burn severity. Here is a look at each: First degree: This type of burn only affects the epidermis, which is the outer layer of skin. Symptoms of first degree burns include redness and pain, and treatment of first degree burns can usually be done at home. Second degree: Second degree burns involve the two outermost layers of skin, the epidermis and the dermis. This type of burn can cause redness, swelling, or blotchy skin. Blisters may develop, pain may be severe, and second degree burns can lead to scarring. Third degree: Third degree burns are those that reach into the fat layer beneath the skin. Burned areas may look black, brown, or white and the skin may look leathery. Third degree burns may cause significant scarring as well as damage to the nerves that can lead to numbness. Burns of particular concern include those that are deep or cover a wide area of the body. The reason for concern is the increased risk of complications, including: Bacterial infection, which may travel to the bloodstream and cause sepsis. Fluid loss, including low blood volume.

TYPES OF BURN INJURIES The CDC explains that there are three different types of burn injuries: First-degree burns: these burns affect the top layer of the skin, and they are often red and painful to touch. In most cases, first-degree burns can heal properly with home treatment, but it is important to seek medical attention in cases where there are first-degree burns over large areas of the body, or cases where a very old or very young person has suffered the burn. Sunburns are a type of first-degree burn. Second-degree burns: this type of burn injury affects the first two layers of the skin, or epidermis. In addition to pain and redness, second-degree burns often result in blisters and some loss of skin. It is extremely important to seek medical attention for second-degree burns and to take steps to prevent the victim from going into shock.

Burn depth is generally categorized as first, second or third degree. A first degree burn is superficial and has similar characteristics to a typical sun burn. The skin is red in color and sensation is intact. In fact, it is usually somewhat painful. Second degree burns look similar to the first degree burns; however, the damage is now severe enough to cause blistering of the skin and the pain is usually somewhat more intense. In third degree burns the damage has progressed to the point of skin death. The skin is white and without sensation. What type of burn did you experience?

They can cause pain, swelling, blistering, and redness Third - Degree: Affects the outer, second, and deep layers of skin. Sometimes they are referred to as full thickness burns The skin will appear white, charred, or burned skin. There will be little to no sensation because the nerve endings will be damaged. Some precautions you can take at home to avoid burns: - Keep chemicals stored safely away from the reach of children - Child-proof electrical sockets - Be sure cords are not frayed - Keep children out of the kitchen area while cooking - Turn pot handles inward to lessen the risk of someone bumping into and spilling anything on themselves or others - Unplug irons, straighteners, curling irons, when not in use - Check water temperature, especially before a child or elderly person is going to use it. - Always check your smoke detector batteries 2x a year.

As with first-degree burns, seconddegree burns will heal on their own with appropriate care, leaving little scarring. Since both the epidermis and dermis are injured in a second-degree burn, it is known as a deep partialthickness or partial-thickness burn. Third-degree burns damage all layers of the skin and in severe cases can injure underlying structures such as muscle and bone. Burns of this type leave charred, blackened, and/or dry, pearly white areas (photos 77 and ). The patient may suffer severe pain. However, this pain is probably the result of nearby second-degree burns, as the nerve endings are often destroyed in third-degree burns. Third-degree burns heal poorly since the regenerative powers of the tissues have been lost. If left to its own resources, the burn usually will scar over from the edges where viable tissue still exists. Skin grafting is required to bring about proper healing of the burn. Thirddegree burns are also defined as full-thickness burns, as they extend throughout all dermal layers and possibly to the subcutaneous layers, muscle, and bone. Photos 77 and 78: Third-degree burns to the foot and arm. Note the blackened and pearly white areas. Some emergency health care providers have moved away from the use of first through third degree as measures of burn depth, replacing these measures with categorizations of either superficial or deep burn.

As they get closer and closer to the window and eventually pass it, the light moves from wall A to its adjacent wall B, and eventually to wall C which is adjacent to B. Since the source of light is essentially traveling a line that is parallel to the window, why does this movement occur? I\u2019m thinking perhaps refraction but I\u2019m still learning the basics. A: Refraction isnt needed to explain this.

In general is there any benefit of using two slabs? A: Look carefully at the two paths that the split beam of light covers, and think about the glass that the light goes through. Beam #1 bounces off the front of the beam splitter, goes over and off the front of a mirror, comes back and goes through the beam splitter at a $45^{circ}$ angle.

Given that he needs to reach the bottom right corner of the grid (N-1, M-1), and that he takes only right/down moves, find the minimum number of mice he will be scared by along such a path. # Explanation: In order to solve this, let us first make a visualization: each mouse casts a shadow of length 1 in all four directions. Thus, LE gets scared of a mouse iff his path passes through its shadow. Note that if it passes through the mouse itself, then it would have had to come through some shadow, and further it would go through some shadow, so we can consider it as if it has passed through the shadow only. Thus, let us assume that we have a shadow grid, where shadow[i][j] = Number of mice that cast a shadow on cell (i, j). Finding the number of mice that LE is scared of, is then just summing up values of shadow!! Well, nearly that. The fact is, we are double-counting.

The dissolution of such ``shadowed solids can enrich the abundances of highly volatile elements as much as other elements, even if proto-Jupiter formed near the current orbit. section{Method}label{sec:Method} subsection{Basic idea} The mid-plane temperature in the outer region of protoplanetary disks is determined by the stellar irradiation grazing at the disk surface. Since the stellar light comes from the center of the disk, a shadowed region where the direct stellar light never reaches is potentially generated, depending on the surface structure of the inner region. For example, a puffed inner disk rim can block off stellar light and cast a shadow, so-called self-shadowing citep{Dullemond+01,Dullemond&Dominik04}. The presence of the self-shadow has been suggested from several disk observations citep[e.g.,][]{Garufi+17,Avenhaus+18}. The shadow can also emerge when dust grains are accumulated somewhere and block off the stellar light. citet{Ueda+19} showed that a dust pileup at the inner edge of the dead zone casts a shadow behind it, producing cold regions of ${sim}50~{rm K}$ at ${sim}2$--$7~{rm AU}$ around a Herbig-type star. One potential mechanism of the shadowing onto the current Jupiter orbit is a dust pileup at the H$ 2$O snow line. The dust surface density inside the H$ 2$O snow line can be enhanced by orders of magnitude because efficient fragmentation slows the radial drift of silicate grains citep{Birnstiel+10, Banzatti+15,Pinilla+17}.

Proportion means it will scale the intensity down. But if k and x are greater than zero , then k*x will always be nonzero. The exception is when you reduce the intensity to less than a photon.

Even though such transparent objects do not absorb or reflect very much light, they still interact with light through refraction. Refraction is what makes transparent cups visible to our eyes. Refraction also enables clear objects to cast shadows. Take off your eyeglasses and place them on the table at night under the illumination of a single lamp and you will see a distinct shadow caused by the transparent lenses. Although air is almost perfectly transparent, it can still cast shadows via refraction. The key principle regarding refraction is that light is bent when the index of refraction differs from one location to the next. Air and glass are different materials and have different indices of refraction. Light therefore bends when it goes from air into glass, such as at the surface of a glass lens. Refraction does not happen inside a glass lens because the material inside the lens is uniform.

A common response, for example, was that media like glass and water are transparent because the light passes through them unimpeded. This is clearly wrong. We can see that its wrong because both glass and water have a tendency to refract incident light. Unimpeded photons always travel in straight lines.

So when light enters a piece of glass (from air), it slows down suddenly. Its just like running down the beach, then hitting the water and slowing down as you have to struggle to move your legs through the water. Okay, so whats this got to do with the light bending? Imagine youre running down the beach with a group of friends, holding hands or with your arms linked together. You run side by side and at the same speed, so you form a nice straight line sweeping across the sand, straight towards the water. Now everyone in the line hits the water at the same time, and everyone suddenly has to slow down.

A: What is happening, in my opinion, is the result of two effects: First one is to notice that the glass of your window is most probably not uniform. Meaning, as a guess, it is thinner on the top and gradually gets thicker to the bottom, but in a very slight manner that only light feels it. What does this cause? Well if the glass also has two different refraction indices, say $n v$ for vertical refraction index and $n h$ for horizontal refraction index, then the polarization of the light traveling through the glass will rotate due to this non-isometry $n h neq n v$. But remember that the glass at some point is thicker than the others; which leads to the fact that"}, {"title": "Document 34", "text": "the way light passes through glass creates an unusual and special beauty that few other mediums provide.

This is truly bizarre; for it seems that the mere presence of second surface of glass alters the reflectiveness of the first. But how does the light \u201cknow\u201d there is a second surface of glass? It seems the light somehow is affected before it comes into contact with either surface. Newton was aware of this awkward problem, and he came up with his theory of \u201cfits of easy reflection or transmission\u201d to explain this phenomenon. But this \u201ctheory\u201d was merely to say that the glass, for some unknown reason, sometimes lets light through, and sometimes reflects it. In other words, it was hardly a theory at all. Every Ray of Light in its passage through any refracting Surface is put into a certain transient Constitution or State, which in the progress of the Ray returns at equal Intervals, and disposes the Ray at every return to be easily transmitted through the next refracting Surface, and between the returns to be easily reflected by it.

As this happens, the molecules gradually move more and more slowly, until they are hardly moving at all. This indecisiveness on the part of glass -- choose a state of matter already! -- has led to the mistaken assumption that glass is actually a fluid. There is an enduring urban legend that the glass windows in medieval cathedrals are thicker at the bottom because over hundreds of years, the glass has flowed downward and pooled at the bottom. There is a tiny bit of truth to the legend. At the molecular level, glass does flow, it just does so very verrry sloooowly. Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide in Australia, has performed detailed calculations on old cathedral windows, and estimates that it would take at least 10 million years for the glass at the bottom to grow just 5% thicker. She emphasizes that this is a conservative estimate; it might take much longer. So theres frankly no way in hell that the irregularities in medieval cathedral windows are due to the flowing properties of glass. Instead, the observed anomalies are probably due to inherent flaws resulting from the manufacturing process. (For more detailed information on the molecular structure of glass, whether or not it can be said to truly flow, and some fascinating early history, see this excellent discussion.)

Why can we see through it when other materials are opaque? Glasses exist in a poorly understood state somewhere between solids and liquids. In general, when a liquid is cooled there is a temperature at which it will \u201cfreeze\u201d, becoming a crystalline solid (eg. water into ice at 0C). Most solid inorganic materials are crystalline and are made up of many millions of crystals, each having an atomic structure which is highly ordered, with atomic units tessellating throughout. The shape of these units can be observed in the shape of single crystals (eg. hexagonal quartz crystals). Glass is different: it is not crystalline but made up of a continuous network of atoms that are not ordered but irregular and liquid-like. This difference in atomic structure occurs because the liquid glass is cooled so quickly that the atoms do not have time to arrange themselves into regular, crystal-like patterns. If cooled fast enough almost any liquid can form glass, even water. However, the rate of cooling must be very fast. Fortunately for us, liquids composed primarily of silicon oxide can be cooled slowly and still form a glass. They get gradually stiffer during cooling until they reach the \u201cglass transition temperature\u201d below which they are effectively solid.

Therefore as photons (as with the nature of the gravitons of gravity) are attracted towards greater densities and quantities of matter and mass; so it follows that each photon when passing through the atoms of the glass lens, will undergo the process of the nucleon gravitational to slingshot effect; whereby with each successive transit of a photon through the atoms of a glass lens; its passage/path of direction, will become more convergent or divergent, relative to the greatest density and/or thickness of the convex or concave lens. In diagrams A and B it can also be seen, that when a light beam is directed straight towards the centre of a convex lens or a glass sphere; the light beam is not subject to the nucleon gravitational to slingshot effect because the nucleon gravitational pull is being exerted in line, and directly forwards towards the opposite side of the lens, by the nucleons present within the greater central density of the convex lens.

To explore what makes glasses different, the Weeks lab uses mixtures of water and tiny plastic balls, each about the size of the nucleus of a cell.

You can see this if you look at figure 2.

The degree of bending of the light path gets less, the nearer to the centre of the lens the light strikes the lens. Figure 2 shows that the light that strikes the lens at its exact centre is not deviated at all \u2013 it passes straight through. This is because the light is striking the glass surface at an exact right-angle. It is a fact that whenever light strikes, or leaves, glass at an exact right-angle its direction of travel is not altered.

Another complication is that the transparency of a substance varies depending on the wavelength of the light. The same object may be transparent to some wavelengths, and opaque to others. Ordinary glass, for example, is transparent to the visible wavelengths, but does a pretty lousy job of transmitting ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Adding certain materials or coatings to the glass can make it even more selective, resulting in filters that only transmit certain colors. Light that we perceive as white often really has equal amounts of all colors (or wavelengths) in the visible range of the spectrum, as discussed in the previous chapter. In the rest of this chapter, for the most part, we will ignore effects that depend on wavelength and concentrate on more general behaviors of visible light. For example, you are probably familiar with the phenomenon of shadows. If you have a single small source of light in a room, any opaque object will cast a sharp shadow on a wall or floor, and that shadow will have the shape of the outline of the object. This tells us that on normal human length scales, light travels in straight lines. This somewhat trivial observation turns out to be an important tool for understanding all of the principles of basic optics. Lets be a little more careful here.

The rod is glowing bright red; the glass is glowing a relatively dim orange. In fact, if we look carefully, we see that the part of the glass immediately next to the end of the rod actually looks dark; that part of the glass may be the coolest part, though its certainly at least as hot as the rod end. The visible orange glow seems to be limited to the portion a fingers width away from the end of the rod, where we might expect the glass to be substantially hotter than the rod. So, what can we say? The glass is apparently transparent, or nearly so; it is glowing, but apparently quite a bit less strongly than the metal rod embedded in it. The second law predicts that transparent glass should glow less brightly than the opaque rod, and that to the extent that the glass glows, it must not be fully transparent. While these photos dont let us conclude anything quantitative about either the brightness or transparency of the glass, they seem to be consistent with what was predicted. Unfortunately we also cant tell from these pictures whether the glass has become any less transparent when heated to the point of glowing.

SIM card holders have traditionally been the size of a credit card, often dwarfing the dimensions of the actual SIM. By reducing the size of the holder, Vodafone will reduce plastic waste by more than 340 tonnes and save up to 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted during the production and transportation for every tonne of plastic reduced.

For example, the A letter bag might have pictures of an ant, a plastic apple, a drawing of an arm, etc. while the B letter bag might have a ball, a picture of a boy, a small boat, etc. After mastering single-letter bags, children followed the same process with bags for letter blends, such as -bl\u2016 or -wr.\u2016 After completing the letter blend bags, children in the literacy group interacted with end sound flash cards, where there is one end sound, such as -ing,\u2016 and multiple possible beginning sound options to create a word using that end sound.

From Table 3, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with Transfer-Transfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attackers engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table 4, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the informa- tion, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question why would you need my credit card number? Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question what is your name? while MISSA was able to generate the response why cant you use my address?, which is consistent to the context.

Next, the machine and the card exchange information to confirm the card and the information it generates is authentic and not fraudulent. Once confirmed, you enter your PIN and complete your transaction. Why Is This More Secure? You need to understand how older credit cards worked to know why chip-and-PIN is considered \u201cmore secure\u201d than previous credit cards. In the past, the only security feature built into a credit card was the magnetic strip on the back. This strip contained information about your line of credit, and it\u2019s what a machine read when you swiped your card at a cash register or through an ATM. The information stored on the strip was tied to your account and is what determined whether or not your payment was accepted. Here\u2019s the thing: this technology is the same used in cassette tapes. But we\u2019re talking about our credit cards and financial information here. You can see why this just wasn\u2019t secure enough to prevent issues like fraud. Stealing data from credit cards with just the magnetic strip is easy for thieves to do. The information is static, it\u2019s not encrypted, and it\u2019s easy to read.

Convenience of making payments from home: In olden days when there was no plastic money, we need to go personally to each place to make a payment be it utility payments or booking tickets. But now you can pay at your own convenience sitting at home with the use of plastic money. For example, you need to go to the travel agency to pay cash for your ticket, instead, you can book your ticket online. Also when a travel agency is involved, they charge commission or fee but when you are booking the ticket directly from the airlines website, you are saving on it. Plastic cards can also be used for online purchases. We can see many online shops coming up these days. If you find something interesting on a website and would want to have it, you can always purchase it anytime using plastic money.

Some believe that simply using plastic for transactions makes us spend more, because it changes how our brains work -- or, at least, how we think -- when were making purchases. However, their case is far from conclusive. A couple of years ago, IndexCreditCards.com reviewed some of the academic research thats tried to explore the supposed link between credit card use and greater spending. Its undeniable that a number of studies suggest such a link, and at least one (Do Payment Mechanisms Change the Way Consumers Perceive Products? from the Journal of Consumer Research) found that people who made purchases using plastic might tend to focus more on a products benefits, while those paying cash tend to focus more on its cost. However, the problem with many of these studies was highlighted in another paper, published in 2009 by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University: Its easy to show a correlation between card use and higher spending, but much harder to demonstrate causation.

A couple of inches above and below the magnetic stripe reader are protrusions that allow just enough room to swipe a credit card. The barriers are a negative affordance (is that the right terminology?); they make swiping a credit card awkward. I have to carefully place my card in the small space above the reader to start. After swiping I always end up jamming the card into the bottom barrier. If one wanted to apply Fittss law to swiping a credit card, and intentionally violate it, this seems like a pretty good way to do so. Yet, there must be a reason those barriers were added, and it doesnt appear to be structural.

It was big and bulky, but a lot of people wouldnt realize that it wasnt the right hardware. I thought these barriers were put in place to prevent the skimmers. The barriers protect against the installation of credit card skimmers.

This sounds kind of cheesy at first, and is usually posed to companies, not individuals, but it is something to think about. As a creator, who are you creating for? Who do you want to help with your work? What group of individuals in your life are the most important to you? Which users do you think about when you are making you choices? First off, before we dive in, lets remember that the answer It depends is incorrect. While your day job might not be about helping those most important to you, you still probably know who that most important group is. Also, just because you change who you design for for every project, does not necessarily mean you dont have one overall group you are aiming for.

Origin of Bust a Bronco This expression first appeared in the late 1800s and comes from the American frontier. Bust comes from burst, which is a synonym for break. Breaking horses is another expression with the same meaning. Cowboys or other people living in the country would use this expression when training horses. They likely used this expression because training horses traditionally has involved breaking their spirit by trying to dominate them. If the horse fears humans, it will be more likely to allow them to ride it. Examples of Bust a Bronco In this example, two sisters talk about their upcoming vacation to a ranch in Colorado. Amy: I can\u2019t believe our parents are making us go to this ranch. Kimberly: Really? I\u2019m super excited for it! Amy: No way. You mean you want to throw lassos and bust a bronco?

Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit spacecraft were originally developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and were later made available for civilian use. Transit receivers used the known characteristics of the satellites orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellites radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on Earth. As a single spacecraft travelled overhead, the user measured the Doppler shift over a 15 minute period by receiving timing marks and satellite orbital information on two separate frequencies, 149.99 and 399.97 MHz. These signals were corrected for ionospheric refraction and the information was then fed into the users navigation system. Individual Transit satellites operated for over 10 years. Technical breakthroughs during the program included gravity gradient stabilization, use of radio-isotope thermoelectic generators (RTG), and navigation satellite technologies later used in the GPS system.

What does this have to do with radio waves? Without interference, radio waves travel in a straight line from the broadcast source, ultimately hitting the ionosphere. What happens after is dependent on a variety of factors, notable among them being the frequency of the waves and the density of the free electrons. For AM waves, given the right conditions, they will essentially bounce back and forth between the ground and the ionosphere, propagating the signal farther and farther. So clearly the ionosphere can potentially play an important part in the terrestrial radio process. But it is the constantly shifting nature of the ionosphere that makes things really interesting.

In any event, the ionosphere\u2019s composition changes most drastically at night, primarily because, of course, the Sun goes missing for a bit. Without as abundant a source of ionizing rays, the D and E levels (pictured right) of the ionosphere cease to be very ionized, but the F region (particularly F2) still remains quite ionized.

The Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite burned up in Earths atmosphere during a planned reentry on Nov. 28, leaving behind a treasure trove of data about a part of the space environment thats difficult to study. The unique set of sustained observations from C/NOFS will greatly improve models currently used to predict satellite trajectories, orbital drag and uncontrolled re-entry. Scientists from the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the University of Texas (UT) at Dallas are presenting the results at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco. Launched on April 16, 2008, C/NOFS studied a region high above in our atmosphere called the ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles created by ultra-violet radiation from the sun. This layer lies some 40 to 600 miles above the Earths surface, where it interacts and co-mingles with the neutral particles of the tenuous upper atmosphere. The upper atmosphere and ionosphere change constantly in response to forces from above and below, including explosions on the sun, intense upper atmosphere winds, and dynamic electric field changes. In addition to interfering with satellite orbits, such changes can produce turbulence in the ionosphere that cause whats known as scintillations, which interfere with"}, {"title": "Document 20", "text": "heat [1]. With enough heat, the gases in the air within the shock wave will ionize and, thus, an electron plasma is created. The presence of a plasma layer causes attenuation of the electromagnetic signals propagating through it. These signals are associated with a variety of radio frequency (RF) systems such as voice communications, telemetry, and global positioning system (GPS) data. The attenuation increases as the thickness and density of the plasma surrounding the reentry vehicle increases. An illustration of the plasma sheath surrounding a reentry vehicle is given in Figure 1. Regions of lower and higher plasma density near the vehicle are indicated. The associated effects can become so severe that complete loss of voice communications and even GPS acquisition can occur. This RF blackout can last anywhere from 90 s to 10 min depending on the trajectory and velocity of the reentry vehicle [3]. It has had severe consequences, for example, in the unmanned Genesis mission to collect samples of solar winds. During reentry of the capsule, a sensor failure caused a parachute to not deploy. If mission control had been in contact with it, a backup parachute could have been deployed to avoid the capsule from crashing into the Utah desert [4]. Similarly, hypersonic flight has been pursued with both manned and un-manned vehicles since 1961, e.g., with the X-15 hypersonic airplane which flew at Mach 6.7 using only rockets [5].

This phenomena (the I) is the main reason why it is highly unlikely any advanced ET civilization could ever see or hear our early radio and TV from another planet or star system. Mainly because most of the legacy signal (in HF and lower freqs) where just reflected back at Earth by the I. Not much Amos"}, {"title": "Document 28", "text": "has weather.

It is essentially a shell of electrons and charged particles called plasma created by ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Most rockets follow a curved trajectory after launch and deliver satellites to an altitude of about 200 kilometers (125 miles), creating a V-shaped shock wave in the ionosphere. After that, operators on the ground remotely maneuver the satellite to get it to the correct altitude and angle. But the FORMOSAT-5 launch, Taiwan\u2019s first self-made satellite, was unique. The satellite was originally scheduled to launch with several others but was delayed because of a Falcon 9 launchpad explosion in September 2016.

This region, where the earth\u2019s atmosphere bumps into space, has more going on in it than first meets the eye. As more and more miniature CubeSats are launched, along with fleet and asset tracking satellites in low earth orbit, new challenges are being encountered that require a better understanding of this boundary region. NASA wants to understand this region to a much greater extent, and on Dec 8, 2017, they plan to launch the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON), to learn more about this critical region of growing importance. Launched on a Pegasus rocket from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, the satellite will investigate how things like weather patterns on the earth, from hurricanes, to stiff winds blowing over the top of a mountain, interact and affect the electrically charged part of the atmosphere, known as the ionosphere. Researchers are interested, because the charged particles of the ionosphere can disrupt communications signals as well as cause low-Earth orbit satellites to become electrically charged, which can damage them. In severe cases, these particles can cause power outages on the ground. It was formerly thought that all such effects were due to the sun, however it seems that since these particles are right at the edge of space, they may also be affected by conditions on Earth.

Such a dense atmosphere tends to absorb rather than reflect radio waves, especially at lower frequencies. Table 1 - Relative conductivity of various types of terrain. But in the sparse regions of the ionosphere where there are relatively few gas molecules, the ions reattach themselves at fairly slow rates. In the upper regions of the ionosphere, called the F2 layer, recombination is so slow as to be relatively unimportant. The important thing about these ions is that they make the atmosphere electrically conductive. Thus the electromagnetic energy of a radio wave is partially transformed into kinetic energy represented by the motions of the ions. If these ions do not recombine, this energy is converted back to electromagnetic energy and the radio wave continues to be propagated. If, on the other hand, the ions recombine, absorption of the radio wave occurs and the wave is sharply attenuated. Now, one of the most important factors about this ionization is the fact that the greater the degree of ionization, the higher the frequency that will be refracted and returned to the surface of the earth. For any one frequency, there is a degree of ionization that is required to refract the wave sufficiently to return it to earth depending upon the angle of radiation. Frequencies higher than this, for the same angle, will not be sufficiently refracted and will not return to the earth.

Radio signals can and do collide with other objects in space, and definitely do disperse between the spacecraft and the Earth, but they will reach the Earth for two reasons. The first; even though our solar system has a lot of stuff in it, the vast majority of it is still empty space. The second is that all spacecraft are equipped with finely tuned and precisely calibrated antennas, which allow them to aim their signal directly at the earth, rather than beaming its signal in every direction. Beaming signal in every direction would require a lot of power to produce, so it\u2019s much more efficient to use a smaller amount of power to limit the signal to only direction you care about, i.e., in the direction of Earth. Now, if you\u2019re a spacecraft orbiting another planet, you can easily imagine that the planet will occasionally get in the way of you beaming information back to the Earth. Radio signals do not go through planets, and nor do they go on curved paths. So the spacecraft, in these times, must be capable of running itself for a while, before it comes back around from the far side of the planet (from an Earthly perspective).

After colliding with our object, the air in the zone of the shockwave can achieve local temperature of several thousand to several tens of thousands of degrees.

The ionosphere and the ions present there tend to interfere with these signals. Changes in the ions, their density, and localization in the ionosphere will affect how satellites record data and communicate it. But the ionosphere is just invisible air, after all, right? Correct, but airglow is like an indicator to see and observe changes in the ionosphere. Changes in the characteristic photometric spectrum emitted by the ionosphere is how changes in the ionosphere are detected. The composition of the ionosphere is affected by the weather in space, as well as the weather conditions on Earth. The weather on Earth, the intensity of solar radiation, and gravity waves are some of the causes of changes in the ionosphere. Gravity waves are created when there is a disturbance between a fluid medium and gravity or buoyancy tries to restore the fluid to how it originally was or attain equilibrium.

When the ionosphere becomes heavily ionized, the gases may even glow and be visible. This phenomenon is known as Northern and Southern Lights. \u2022 Why is the ionosphere important in HF radio? Well, this blanket of gases is like nature\u2019s satellite, making HF BLOS radio communications possible. When radio waves strike these ionized layers, depending on frequency, some are completely absorbed, others are refracted so that they return to the earth, and still others pass through the ionosphere into outer space.

This is determined by wavelength and the type of transmitting antenna. Like a billiard ball bouncing off a rail, a radio wave reflects from the ionosphere at the same angle it hits it.

The latter is funded by the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) program of the European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 scheme (grant no. 899298). Atmospheric entry imposes one of the harshest environments which a spacecraft can experience. The combination of hypersonic velocities and the rapid compression of atmospheric particles by the spacecraft leads to high-enthalpy, partially ionised gases forming around the vehicle. This inhibits radio communications and induces high thermal loads on the spacecraft surface. For the former problem, spacecraft can sometimes rely on satellite constellations for communicating through the plasma wake and therefore preventing the blackout. On the other hand, expensive, heavy, and non-reusable thermal protection systems (TPS) are needed to dissipate the severe thermal loads. Such TPS can represent up to 30% of an entry vehicles weight, and especially for manned missions they can reduce the cost- efficiency by sacrificing payload mass. Such systems are also prone to failure, putting the lives of astronauts at risk. The use of electromagnetic fields to exploit MHD principles has long been considered as an attractive solution for tackling the problems described above.
