In situations where people are injured by these sources, your first aid knowledge should include how to treat them. This lesson covers different types of burns, how to treat them, and ways to prevent them. There are several types and degrees of burns that require different treatments. Heat, electricity, and chemicals can produce burn injuries; their severity depends upon the burns depth, size, and location. Burns can be painful and may result in shock and infection. They can be very serious if they are spread over a large area of the body, there are other injuries involved, or the victim is very young or very old. Degrees of Burns For burns caused by heat sources, there are different degrees (first, second, or third) based on the burns depth. The deeper the burn, the more severe and the higher the degree. All electrical burns are third degree. Characteristics of First-Degree Burns There are several characteristics of first-degree burns. These include: Least severe Injure only the top layer of skin Redden the skin Produce mild swelling Cause pain due to irritated nerve endings Heal quickly and completely if properly treated Caused by brief contact with hot objects, brief exposure"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "a 2nd degree burn. State of Shock \u2013 When in shock, a person may feel weakness, a drop in alertness; his/her lips and fingernails might turn blue. It is highly likely to be induced by a 3rd degree burn. Swelling \u2013 Swelling of affected area usually indicates 1st or 2nd degree burns. White or Charred Skin \u2013 Whitening of skin or even a charred black appearance is typical of a 3rd degree burn. It is often a difficult task to diagnose an electrical burn. Such burns tend to cause drastic injury beneath the skin while leaving the outer skin relatively unaffected. Type and cause of a burn will determine, to a large extent, how it is to be treated. Infection is a concern with all burns. We should be careful about signs of infection when a burn is in the process of healing. Chemical burns may require specific treatment and should be treated by a medical expert. 1st Degree Burns - Minor burns or 1st degree burns can be treated most often with antibiotic ointments or even aloe vera gel. An important first aid measure for a minor burn is to place the affected area under cold running water for some time. 2nd Degree Burns - Second-degree burns can also be treated with antibiotic creams; however, consult a doctor when the symptoms of a 2nd degree burn become apparent. As first aid, place the affected area under cold water at a tepid flow. Sometimes, in an infection prone environment, the burn will need to be covered."}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "and constrict. Burns are measured in degrees - from 1st (least severe) to 4th (very severe). First degree burns result in reddened skin, and hurt more then their severity might suggest. A mild sun burn is an example. Second degree burns are very painful. The skin will be red and may \"blister\" or \"weep\"; or it may be pink to spotty red, and be dry. Third degree burns are very deep. They appear dry and leathery, and may be pearly white, cherry red, brown, or yellow. Some areas will be black, hard and dry. The patient will feel little to no pain as the nerves are mostly destroyed. Pre-hospital treatment for all serious thermal burns is the same. First, stop the burning - remove source of heat and remove or cool burning clothing, boots, shoes, jewelry, etc. If clothing sticks, do not pull hard to remove it. Cool with water until skin returns to normal temperatures. Cover with clean DRY sheet. DO NOT USE ICE as it could damage the tissue. Make the patient as comfortable as possible, and provide TLC. For any burns to the face, chest, feet or genital areas, seek immediate medical attention. Burns can also result from dry or liquid chemicals, electricity, or lightning.

Make sure to replace the dressing and keep the area clean by changing the dressing daily, using warm water and soap to rinse the area, and an antibiotic cream. If the victim's blisters break open, carefully wash them with soap and water. 3rd Degree Burns: May appear charred or ash colored, could begin to peel or blister. 3rd degree burns are the worst type of burns because they do the most damage to the victim.

Of course, third and fourth-degree burns cannot be treated at home. You should call your doctor immediately. The pain of second-degree burns can be relieved with cold water first and treated with cream and medication. The first-degree burns can heal itself. However, natural home remedies can fasten the healing process. This article about the list of first aid for burns focuses on natural treatments for the first and second-degree burns. Here are natural treatments for Burns on VKool.com that can be used as the first aid for the burn at home. The first aid for the burn I would like to introduce in this article is cold water. When you have minor burns and feel the pain, you should let your affected skin areas under the running cold water immediately within a couple of minutes. Alternatively, you can utilize a cold compress for treating minor burns. For a satisfactory result, you should repeat this treatment every few hours. The cold temperature can relieve the discomfort and pain caused by burns. However, unlike other skin damages, you should not use ice for the cold compress. This is because it can damage delicate tissues. Do not use this treatment for second and third-degree burns.

You can prepare yourself by learning basic first aid steps to deal with a burn injury. In this guide, we\u2019ll discuss the classification of burns in children and the correct first aid treatment for a child with burns. Burns are classified and treated according to the degree and extent of tissue damage and the type of agent responsible. Burns to the face, neck, crotch, feet, and joints are generally more serious than other burns. First-degree burns are minor, affecting only the outer layer of skin (epidermis). They may cause pain, reddening and mild swelling, but they do not produce blisters. Second-degree burns involve both the epidermis and underlying dermis layers of skin, resulting in blistering and oozing in addition to pain, reddening, and swelling. Third-degree burns are the most serious, destroying all the layers of skin and damaging underlying tissue, including nerves. In most instances of third-degree burns, there is no pain because the nerves have been destroyed. The burned area may appear white or blackened due to charring, and the underlying muscle or other tissue is exposed. Call for immediate emergency help. Keep the child calm and lying down until emergency help arrives. Chemical burns can be caused by either acidic or alkaline substances.

When deciding the degree of a burn, in addition to the previous descriptions, it may help to know the source of the burn and/or how hot the source was, as well as how long the victim was exposed to it. If a victim appears to have a combination of burns of different degrees, determine the degree of the most burned partusually in the middle of the burned areaand treat for that degree. If you are not sure about the degree of a burn, treat it as a third-degree burn. Keep in mind that the goal of burn treatment is to relieve the victims pain, prevent him/her from going into shock, and prevent infection of the burned area. Treating First-Degree Burns To treat first-degree burns, follow these steps: 1. Loosen tight clothing and remove jewelry from the burned area before it swells. Have the victim put his/her jewelry in a safe place after removal. 2. Cool the burned part with water by either holding it under cold, running water, pouring cold water over it, immersing it in cold water, or applying cold, wet compresses to it. Cooling the burn with water helps remove heat from the skin, relieves pain and swelling, and cleans the injury. Continue this cooling treatment for between five and 15 minutes until the pain subsides. 3. Gently pat the burned area dry with a clean cloth. 4.

Depending on the severity of the first or second degree burn and the agent that caused the burn, there may be some pigment changes, meaning the burn site may end up being a different color than the surrounding skin. Avoid sun exposure to this area as the sun may actually worsen the appearance. third and fourth degree burns-while a prolonged course of therapy may not be ascertained initially, certain aspects of treatment should be started immediately in an effort to relieve pain and prevent further burn destruction.

Otherwise, you risk serious, possibly life-threatening, infection and loss of bodily tissue. In cases of a simple first-degree burn or scald (quick touch to a heated surface or liquid), you have to cool the skin temperature to normalize it as quickly as possible. This is best-done by running the burned/scalded skin under cold running (clean) water until the first \u201cburning\u201d sensation has reduced or passed (at least for one minute). This will also hopefully clean the wound of any foreign substance, such as charred material or chemical irritants. Next, you want to disinfect and numb the tissue, both to prevent infection from the compromised area (cohesive skin is the most powerful exterior barrier to infection our body has) and to numb the area\u2019s nerves that perceive burning pain. This helps to abate the hyper-inflammatory process that can result from sudden tissue insult, such as a burn. This can be achieved in several ways. The easiest is to apply a combination disinfectant/numbing ointment such as Neosporin \u201cwith Pain Relief\u201d (lidocaine). The disinfectants, combined with the topical numbing agent lidocaine, help the metabolism of the tissue resist infection until the skin (dermis layers affected) has healed sufficiently to do so unaided. Aloe Vera gel has also been used as a demulcent (skin-soother) since antiquity, and you can add this after the disinfectant/numbing agents.

Common causes of burn injuries include: Fire/flame Scalding from steam or hot liquids Touching hot objects Electrical burns Chemical burns Unsafe use of firecrackers Categories of Burn Injuries There are four categories of burn injuries: First-degree burns usually affect the outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis. A first-degree burn tends to be moist and red in color. A burn of this nature is generally resolved within a week. Superficial second-degree burn penetrates the entire epidermal layer of skin and extends down to the next skin layer, known as the dermis. A second-degree burn[2] may appear moist and pinkish in color. A superficial second-degree burn may heal spontaneously, often within two weeks. Full-thickness third-degree burns differ from the superficial second- degree burns because the tissue destruction runs deeper into the dermis. A full-thickness burn will be dry and whitish in color. It will not produce red blanches with an application of pressure. This type of burn may take three to four weeks to heal. Third-degree burns are the most severe classification. This occurs when the burn destroyed both the epidermal and dermal layers of skin and extended down to the subcutaneous tissue. These burns may be physically depressed, charred, and often leather-like in appearance. These burns are very serious and often require skin grafting[3] or other reconstructive procedures."}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2021-04", "text": "Personal Injury Lawyer Blog Burn Injuries in Personal Injury Cases Blog, Personal Injury Burn accidents are quite common in the United States, generating thousands of personal injury lawsuits each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that burns and fires are the third leading cause of fatal injuries in a home. In 2011, 2,640 people (not counting firefighters) died in fires and another 13,350 were injured, although more people were injured by smoke and toxic gases in fires than by burns. The principal cause of deaths related to fire is the smoke, while cooking is the most common source of home fires. More home fires occur during the winter, and the 37% of home fire injuries occur in residencies that do not have smoke alarm. Additionally, fire and burn injuries cost approximately $7.5 billion every year. Different Type of Burns In a personal injury case, burns are classified into four different categories according to their severity: First Degree Burn First-degree burns are the least severe, but they can still be very painful. They usually cause swelling and redness and only affect the outer layers of the skin, which is called epidermis. Most sunburn falls into this category. This type of burns can be considerate serious if it occurs in a part of the body that is particularly vulnerable. If this type of burn deserves a settlement, the agreement is likely to be low.

In fact, burns are one of the leading causes of death in most age groups, and children under 15 make up almost one-quarter of all burn injuries. While fires and injuries are tragic events, it can be essential that burn injury victims and their families find the right lawyer to advocate for them, as they sustain scarring, life-long disabilities, and even death. Heat, electricity, friction, radiation, and chemicals can cause burn injuries. Doctors classify them in three levels of severity. First-degree burns/superficial burns: These affect only the outer layer (the epidermis) of your skin. The area affected is red, painful, and dry, but not blistered. A mild sunburn is an example of a first-degree burn. These do not usually do long-term damage. Second-degree burns/partial-thickness burns: These affect both the outer layer and part of the underlying layer (the dermis) of your skin. They are red, blistered, and painful. Third-degree burns/full-thickness burns: These destroy all three layers of the skin (the epidermis, dermis, and fat), and often also result in damage to other systems including bones, muscles, and tendons, and can destroy nerve endings.

Only the edges may be able to heal in some full thickness cases. If skin grafting is not done, scars will eventually cover the area which can lead to disfiguration and emotional consequences. All third degree burns require medical treatment immediately. If a person is in shock, it is even more important for those in the surrounding area to contact 911. It can take a long time for a third degree burn to heal. Scars may require multiple operations by a plastic surgeon or skin grafting, depending on the severity of the burns.

Causes and Types of Burn Injuries Most burn injuries are thermal, which means that they occur as a result of the victim coming in contact with a source of heat, such as an open flame, hot stove, etc.In addition to thermal burns, there are also: Electrical burns, which are caused when the body encounters an electrical current; Friction burns, which occur when the skin is scraped or rubbed repeatedly against another surface; Radiation burns, which occur when a person is exposed to radiation, including during cancer treatment therapy; and Chemical burns, which are the result of an individual being exposed to or encountering certain chemicals, including battery acid, chlorine, and bleach. Burns can happen at home, on the job, because of a motor vehicle accident, and even while in nature (i.e. a campfire gets out of control, a person is struck by lightning, etc.). While some burns, including burns occurring because of natural phenomena, are unpredictable and unpreventable, most burn injuries can be avoided. For example, a workplace electrical burn injury may be the result of improper wiring or a lack of thorough worker training, or a home burn injury from a fire may have never occurred but for the lack of properly functioning smoke detectors.

While second-degree burns might not need professional medical treatment, they should always be assessed by a doctor. These burns can extend beyond the first layer of skin and should be treated with caution as they can become infected or have other complications. Third- and fourth-degree burns are the most serious because they are life-threatening, painful, and require extensive medical treatment.

However, when a slow burning fire starts, these ionization detectors cannot detect the heat fast enough to sound the alarm in time, which can lead to unnecessary injury and death.

This is very good news as burn injuries are among the most painful type of personal injury a victim can suffer. Further, they can also result in death due to secondary infections. The reason there is such a high risk of secondary infections is because your skin is the best way to prevent infection, as it serves a barrier to harmful microbes. After a serious burn injury, there is no skin to protect the body from this harmful bacteria. In addition to the risk of serious infections, there is a lot of pain and suffering associated with burn injuries because of the nerve damage which often occurs when the skin is destroyed. It should also be noted, there are different degrees of burns, as most people are aware, but many are not aware that there is also what is known as fourth-degree burn. A first-degree burn is the least serious and is typically the result of a sunburn, for example. A second-degree burn involves redness and blistering, and a third-degree burn involves the destruction of all layers of skin and some of the muscle tissue under the skin.

In other words, it is the interval between two consecutive scale degrees. Any larger interval is called a skip (also called a leap), or disjunct motion. In the diatonic scale, a step is either a minor second (sometimes also called half step) or a major second (sometimes also called whole step), with all intervals of a minor third or larger being skips. For example, C to D (major second) is a step, whereas C to E (major third) is a skip. More generally, a step is a smaller or narrower interval in a musical line, and a skip is a wider or larger interval with the categorization of intervals into steps and skips is determined by the tuning system and the pitch space used. Melodic motion in which the interval between any two consecutive pitches is no more than a step, or, less strictly, where skips are rare, is called stepwise or conjunct melodic motion, as opposed to skipwise or disjunct melodic motion, characterized by frequent skips. Half steps In the major scale or any of its modes, a step will always be a movement of 1 or 2 semitones, and a skip a movement of 3 or more semitones.

As the enemy will also be doing this, it too becomes reciprocal (the third reciprocal action), creating a third push towards an extreme. Confusion with Total War The recognition of total war since the start of World War I has arguably created a degree of confusion for many scholars, who may have failed to understand the differences between it and the concept of absolute war, often using the terms interchangeably and blaming Germany's conduct of \"total war\" on the writings of Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. In reality, however, Clausewitz neither coined nor used the term \"total war,\" and \"absolute (or ideal) war,\" it is argued, is quite a different concept. Total war is essentially a war in which the home front (that is, a state's political system, society and economy) is mobilised to a massive degree for the continuation and expansion of the war effort\u2014it implies the subordination of politics (internal and external) to the goal of purely military victory (a notion that Clausewitz would have regarded as nonsensical).

The subjects were split into 3 separate groups. The first group was tested 20 minutes after learning the pairs, the second was tested 12 hours later without sleep, and the third was tested 12 hours later with sleep in between. The groups were tested in both first degree pairs (A>B, C>D, etc.) and 2nd degree pairs (A>C, B>D, or C>E). The results were that with the first degree pairs, the first group only performed at around chance levels, and the second and third groups had significantly better performances.

Theoretical explanations There are several ways to approach the topic of premelting, the most figurative way might be thermodynamically. A more detailed or abstract view on what physics is important for premelting is given by the Lifshitz and the Landau theories. One always starts with looking at a crystalline solid phase (fig. 1: (1) solid) and another phase. This second phase (fig. 1: (2)) can either be vapour, liquid or solid. Further it can consist of the same chemical material or another. In the case of the second phase being a solid of the same chemical material one speaks of grain boundaries. This case is very important when looking at polycrystalline materials. Thermodynamical picture for solid gas interface In the following thermodynamical equilibrium is assumed, as well as for simplicity (2) should be a vaporous phase. The first (1) and the second (2) phase are always divided by some form of interface, what results in an interfacial energy . One can now ask whether this energy can be lowered by inserting a third phase (l) in between (1) and (2). Written in interfacial energies this would mean: If this is the case then it is more efficient for the system to form a separating phase (3).

Finland is located between 60 and 70 degrees northern latitude and a quarter of its area lies north of the Arctic Circle. In fact, one third of all people living north of the 60th parallel are Finns. The annual mean temperature in the south of the country is around 5 \u00b0C and 0 \u00b0C in the north. The population-weighted average number of heating degree days for Finland is 5000, considerably more than in Sweden and Norway (4000). Thus, the Finnish climate is the coldest in the EU and, consequently, a large share of the energy (22%) is used for the heating of buildings. Finland's energy consumption increased 44% in electricity and 30% in total energy use during the period 1990\u20132006. The increase in electricity consumption of 15,000 GWh (1995\u20132005) was more than Finland's total hydroelectric power capacity. The consumption increased almost equally in all sectors (industry, residential, and services). The share of renewable electricity in Finland has been stable (1998\u20132005): 11-12% plus yearly variable hydroelectric power, totaling 24-27%. The forest industries contributed 57% of the RE power generation via black liquor and wood burning in 1990. By 2005 this share had grown to 67%. The rest consisting primarily of hydroelectric power.

In defining heart rates that are too slow or too fast, it is important to understand the ranges of pediatric heart rates by age. Normal ranges of pediatric heart rates change with age, with heart rates being faster closer to birth and slower closer to adulthood. Bradyarrythmias Bradycardia is defined as a slow heart rate for a child's age. Bradycardia associated with signs of shock (altered mental status, hypotension, etc.) can be an early warning sign for cardiac arrest. Signs of bradycardia include fatigue, confusion, dizziness, and lightheadedness. Possible causes of bradycardia include hypoxia, hypothermia, and certain medications.

It is used as an important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although sociolinguistic factors are often also used. Intelligibility between languages can be asymmetric, with speakers of one understanding more of the other than speakers of the other understanding the first. When it is relatively symmetric, it is characterized as \"mutual\". It exists in differing degrees among many related or geographically proximate languages of the world, often in the context of a dialect continuum. Intelligibility Factors An individual's achievement of moderate proficiency or understanding in a language (called L2) other than their first language (L1) typically requires considerable time and effort through study and practical application if the two languages are not very closely related. Advanced speakers of a second language typically aim for intelligibility, especially in situations where they work in their second language and the necessity of being understood is high. However, many groups of languages are partly mutually intelligible, i.e. most speakers of one language find it relatively easy to achieve some degree of understanding in the related language(s).

The insert motor was considered the fourth stage and was incorporated into the satellite payload in the same manner as the Martlet 4. One of the most notable differences between the Martlet 4 and the GLO-1B was the elimination of the Attitude Control Module between the second and third stages. A dedicated Attitude Control Module was eliminated by modifying the flight profile of the GLO-1B vehicle. The Martlet 4 vehicle used the Attitude Control Module to insure the pitch and yaw of the vehicle was within set parameters prior to the ignition of the second and third stages. With the GLO-1B this was simplified by modifying the mission sequence which made it necessary to provide attitude control for the third stage only. The first stage of the GLO-1B was unguided and, in the same manner as the Martlet 4, relied on both spin stabilization and the fixed geometry of the barrel to insure a predictable flight path prior to first stage ignition. The Martlet 4 flight profile specified a delay between the first stage burnout and second stage ignition during which the Attitude Control Module was activated to insure the vehicles orientation was correct prior to the second stage burn. The GLO-1B eliminated this delay and the need to re-orient the vehicle by igniting the second stage immediately after first stage burn out and separation, which allowed the second stage to share the first stage's orientation.

Singapore The graduate diploma is an academic or vocational qualification; as an academic qualification it is often taken after a bachelor's degree although sometimes only a foundation degree is required. It is usually awarded by a university or a graduate school and usually takes two terms of study to complete. It is also possible for academic graduate diploma holders to progress to a master's degree on an accelerated pathway compared to first embarking on a 3- or 4-year degree program. To ensure that the graduate diploma qualification is recognised, the awarding body must be registered with the Singapore Ministry of Education, like SUSS, NUS, JCU, SIPMM, etc. The graduate diploma is generally a professional conversion qualification to reskill a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the GDipPsy - Graduate Diploma in Psychology is aimed at offering specialised skills in psychology. See also postgraduate diploma. The graduate diploma is offered at different levels by different institutions. The National University of Singapore requires study at master's level, but the graduate diplomas at the Singapore University of Social Sciences are UK (i.e. bachelor's-level) graduate diplomas awarded by the University of London and similarly the Ngee Ann - Adelaide Education Centre offers Australian graduate diplomas (i.e. Australian honours degree level) awarded by the University of Adelaide.

This has been my most effective and efficient means to achieve gains and build mass. When it comes to sets, I typically perform 2 working sets and an additional 1 to 2 warm-up sets. If I have truly gone to failure during the first and second sets, the third set is usually much weaker and tends to have an unintended impact of reducing my motivation. So that third set usually doesn't happen for me! Remember, the key here is to get stronger over 8 to 10 reps, not to have the endurance to run high repetitions for 3, 4, or even 5 sets! If you can max out on a rep range of 8 to 10 reps for more than 5 sets, you are not reaching failure in those first few sets and/or you could be resting for too long between sets. Increase your weight, lower your rep count, and watch the clock. Try to rest somewhere between 45 seconds and 1 minute and 15 seconds between sets, no longer. Feeling \"the burn\" in your muscles over the duration of a long set will not necessarily cause efficient muscle growth. Attempting to max-out every rep within a set or lifting insanely heavy weights to the point your whole body is shaking and the capillaries in your eyes begin to burst will not help much either.

I'm using an iMac and once I've completed the burn onto a DVD, I would like to make it as easy as possible for people to view the DVD with most computers. I am given a choice of downloading my images and music with either MP4 480p and DVD ISO. What are the differences?Also, is there a difference in quality between the two? A: You want DVD ISO. A \"proper\" DVD uses MPEG2 - so MP4 will not be playable on \"DVD only\" players, where a DVD ISO will. I don't believe you can make a call as to which will provide better performance. MP4 will typically make much smaller files (or better quality video) for the same file size, although 480p is not a very big standard. That said, if you don't have that much content you can proabably get similar quality images out of each format, ie if you have way less then 1 disks worth of information at ISO DVD quality and you increase the bit rate (if its an option), you can land up with just as high a quality output - the only disadvantage will be working with larger files and thus longer disk burn times. I'm only about 90% sure, but there probably won't be any difference in audio quality - although to some degree it depends on how the audio is encoded.

For example, the third hollow projection 230 is oriented with its apexes 222 offset from the apexes 184 of the first segment 168 and the apexes 198 of the second segment 186 by, for example, approximately thirty degrees. When the third hollow projection 230 of the disk 160 interlocks with a cavity 226 of an adjacent disk 160, the adjacent disk 160 is offset by the same degree of offset between the apexes 222 of the third hollow projection 230 and the apexes 184 of the first segment 168. Thus, the offset of the apexes 222 of the third hollow projection 230 compared to the apexes 184 of the first segment 168 determines the degree of offset between the apexes 184 of adjacent disks. When the apexes 222 of the third hollow projection 230 are rotated by thirty degrees as compared to the apexes 184 of the first segment 168, the disk 160 will interlock or nest with an adjacent disk 160 such that the apexes 184 of adjacent disks are offset by thirty degrees.

A burn is the effect of dry heat applied to some part of the human body, a scald being the result of moist heat. Clinically there is no distinction between the two, and their classification and treatment are identical. In Dupuytren's classification, now most generally accepted, burns are divided into six classes according to the severest part of the lesion. Burns of the first degree are characterized by severe pain, redness of the skin, a certain amount of swelling that soon passes, and later exfoliation of the skin. Burns of the second degree show vesicles (small blisters) scattered over the inflamed area, and containing a clear, yellowish fluid. Beneath the vesicle the highly sensitive papillae of the skin are exposed. Burns of this degree leave no scar, but often produce a permanent discoloration. In burns of the third degree, there is a partial destruction of the true skin, leaving sloughs of a yellowish or black colour. The pain is at first intense, but passes off on about the second day to return again at the end of a week, when the sloughs separate, exposing the sensitive nerve filaments of the underlying skin. This results in a slightly depressed cicatrix, which happily, however, shows but slight tendency to contraction.

While some kinds of burns may need minor medical intervention, palliative care, emergency surgery or a combination of all; deep seated burns can result in life-threatening complications. Such burns affecting a major part of the body may need immediate medical intervention. People may also require medical care at specialized burn centers and prolonged medical treatments of various kinds. These include not only healing the burnt body parts but also, at times, reconstruction of minor organs or even plastic surgery. Burns are classified in three degrees. A first-degree burn is usually a minor burn affecting only the outer layer of skin and normally causes redness and pain. The second-degree burn affects epidermis and dermis, the first two layers of skin and may develop in swelling, blisters and at times scarring. A third-degree burn reaches the fat beneath the skin and may look brown, black or white. It is likely to destroy nerves and cause numbing. So what causes burns and how can we prevent them?

The severity of a burn is determined by its depth, the age of the patient, the particular sites on the body burnt (hands, feet, face, genitals and joints are the most complicated) and the total surface area of the burns. While minor burns usually cause nothing more than temporary shock and mild discomfort, severe or widespread burns can be physically destructive, permanently debilitating and even fatal. Types of burns Burns can be classified by the depth of tissue they injure. The names for various types of burns have changed over the years.Superficial burn \u2013 previously known as first-degree burns, these are minor burns which affect only the outer layer of skin, the epidermis. They may become red, inflamed and painful, but generally heal within 10 days with no scarring.

Catastrophic Injury Type - Severe Burns Catastrophic or severe burns can occur as a result of industrial or workplace accidents and road accidents where spilt fuel, oil or other flammable material is ignited as a result of the vehicle collision. Burns are commonly defined as being tissue damage that is caused by heat, exposure to radiation, chemicals or electrical currents. The severity of a burn injury can vary significantly and can depend on how deep the tissue damage is, how extensive the area of the burns are and what parts of the body are burnt. Second degree burns are burns that affect both the epidermis and the dermis or second layer of skin. These burns can cause swelling and skin discoloration. Second degree burns can cause extreme pain which is often intensified by significant blistering of the skin. Second degree burns often cause scarring. Third degree burns penetrate through to the fat layer beneath the skin and can leave affected areas looking black, brown or white in appearance. The affected area may also look leathery. Third degree burns often destroy nerves and can cause numbness.

While burns are a very common injury, there are other injuries that can be just as severe and have an equally detrimental impact on a persons\u2019 life. There are two types of burns from fires: flash burns and burns from flames. Flash burns result from a sudden intense heat, which usually result from some form of explosion. Generally, people who have sustained flash burns can be treated as an outpatient and do not require extensive medical care. On the other hand, those who suffer burns from flames may incur extensive damage depending on the severity of the burn. There are four widely accepted burn types, which are separated by degrees. First-degree burns affect only the top layer of skin, which is known as the epidermis. In these burn types the skin is usually red and painful, however, this burn is usually equivalent to a sunburn and the healing process normally does not take longer than 3-5 days. Second-degree burns can be classified as either partial or full thickness burns and are more severe than first degree burns. In a partial thickness burn, there can be a blister that involved the entire skin and upper layers of the skin known as the dermis.

Burns that damage muscles underneath the subcutaneous skin layer are described as full thickness burns with injury to the underlying muscle (sometimes formerly called fourth degree burns). Superficial burns normally heal within 5 to 7 days. A common type of superficial burn is a sunburn. Because the top layer of skin (the epidermis) is thin (about the thickness of a piece of paper), it is easily replaced. Even when skin is not injured, the skin completely replaces the epidermis every 45 to 75 days. Healing from a superficial burn usually occurs without scarring, although there may be some permanent discoloration. The dermis is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis. As a result, the seriousness of a partial thickness (or dermal) burn depends on how much of the dermis has been injured. A deep and large partial thickness burn will usually be treated with skin grafting. Partial thickness burns usually leave scars. A full thickness burn destroys tissue in all three layers of skin, resulting in the loss of not only the skin but also the hair follicles, sweat glands, and the region where new skin cells are formed. For these reasons, full thickness burns require skin grafts. Fourth degree burns extend through the skin into underlying tissues - ligaments and muscle. These are often life-threatening.

A variety of scenarios can lead to electrical burns such as defective electronic devices like hairdryers, curling irons, and cell phones. Poor or old electrical wiring can also cause fires and pose a risk for anyone nearby who comes in contact. Traffic Accidents Another common source of burns is motor vehicle accidents. Car accidents, truck accidents, and motorcycle accidents can all lead to fires, and sometimes dangerous explosions depending on the force of impact. Radiation burns are far less frequent than other types of burns, but they do happen. Aside from a catastrophe at a nuclear power plant, the average person is typically only exposed to radiation as part of medical treatment. Radiation is used for x-rays and other diagnostic imaging and cancer patients also receive radiation treatment to shrink tumors. When medical providers improperly administer treatment, severe internal burn injuries can occur. Types of Burn Injuries Medical professionals who help burn victims need language to evaluate burns, so they can provide the proper diagnosis and treatment. Types of burns are categorized by degree. Here is a broad overview of each type of burn: First-degree burns are minor burns that cause damage to the top layer of skin, called the epidermis.

These are burns that have damaged all of the layers of the skin down to the dermis beneath. The treatment of these burns should be carried out by and in consultation with a trained professional. How a burn is treated depends very much on where it is and the extent of the burn. For severe facial burns, the first step is usually cleaning and debriding the wound. This involves removing the dead tissue that could become infected and ensuring that no dirt or other matter is left inside. If infections look like they are forming, the patient will be given antibiotics, either as topical ointments/creams or an intravenous solution. In many cases, patients will be given a tetanus shot. Pain relief and intravenous fluids are usually applied to promote healing, reduce harmful inflammation, and control pain. For severe burns, there is often very little that can be done to save the tissue that has been damaged. In order to prevent infection, the dead tissue is removed.

Permanent Scarring Due to a Burn Injury If a burn injury victim is fortunate, the physical harm caused will not permanently damage their muscles, nerves, and other deep tissues. Irreversible scarring is likely to still occur, however, in any sort of accident that causes a burn injury. Given enough time, the scar tissue will no longer be sensitive to heat and touch but the victim is not fully recovered. They may experience a lowered self-esteem or diminished value of their own looks and identity. The result is physical scarring that leads to mental scarring as well.

Scalds from hot liquids and steam, building fires and flammable liquids and gases are the most common causes of burns. Another kind is an inhalation injury, caused by breathing smoke. Each year in the United States, about a half-million people seek medical attention for burns and 40,000 are hospitalized 3) and approximately 4,000 people die each year from fire and burn injuries 4). Burns can be caused by scalding from hot liquids or cooking oils, contact with flames, or from overexposure to the sun. Burn also can be electrical (e.g., when a child bites an electrical cord) or chemical (e.g., resulting from swallowing or spilling bleach on your skin). Household burns lead to nearly 7 of 10 admissions to burn centers. The good news is that the number of deaths from severe burns has dropped by more than half over the past 4 decades, in large part because of treatments developed through research. First-degree burns damage only the outer layer of skin (the epidermis). It may cause redness, swelling and pain. It usually heals with first-aid measures within several days to a week. Sunburn is a classic example. Second-degree burns: This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin (dermis). It may cause red, white or splotchy skin, pain, and swelling.

Prognosis is worse for severe burns. Consider child abuse or neglect when dealing with hot water burns in children; abuse accounts for 15% of pediatric burns. Special concerns are sharply demarcated wounds, immersion injuries, and suspect stories. Involve child welfare services early. Predominant gender: males account for 70%. House fires cause 75% of deaths. Increase in burns from the illegal production of methamphetamines. Patients can present with a combination of chemical burn, thermal burn, and explosion injury. Open flame and hot liquid are the most common causes of burns (heat usually \u226545\u00b0C): flame burns more common in adults; scald burns are more common in children. Young children and older adults with thin skin are more susceptible to injury. Lack of smoke detectors: Lacking or nonfunctioning smoke alarms are implicated in 63% of residential fires. Home safety education should be a key mechanism for injury prevention. Families educated on home safety were more likely to have safe hot water temperatures. Safety education results in more families having functioning smoke alarms and increased use of fireguards.

You realize that he has a significant burn, one that needs medical attention. How should you handle this scary situation? This scenario is our opportunity to talk about burns. These injuries are common in children, particularly scalds from hot liquids. Many parents remember from first-aid classes that we commonly classify burns in increasing order of severity as first-, second-, or third-degree burns. Physicians now generally speak of _superficial_ , _partial_ _thickness_ , and _full_ _thickness_ burns, although you will still hear the earlier terms frequently. The newer classification makes sense because it describes the skin injury: just the top (superficial), into the dermal layer (partial thickness), or entirely through the skin (full thickness). How we manage burns depends on the severity of the burn and its location. Burns such as the one in this scenario are typically of mixed type. For example, they may be superficial in some places and partial thickness in others.

This happens when the damage is so extensive that the nerves have been completely destroyed. However, the area around the burn may be extremely painful. A third degree burn is the most severe type of burn and the pain may cause breathing problems and increased pulse rate and leave terrible scarring. Proper care of burns is vital, because burns can be quite painful and leave disfiguring and disabling scarring. Burns can be complicated by shock, infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, electrolyte imbalance and respiratory distress. Large burns can be fatal, but modern treatments, improved the treatment of such burns, especially in children and young adults. Burn injury victims may be prescribed pressure garments to wear. Pressure garments are used to minimize scar formation. Compression garments are fitted to the special needs of each burn victim, and customarily worn at least 23 hours a day, but removing for washing or bathing. However the duration of pressure garment therapy may vary, and last one year or more. Exercise is important to keep muscles and joints moving freely and comfortably, with full ranges of motion.

The measurement is done by the depth of the burn combined with the surface area affected. It's a complicated assessment process to determine whether burns are critical or not. It can be simpler to decide whether a burn needs to be seen by a professional at all. Most small first-degree burns, and sometimes even second-degree burns, don't need a healthcare provider.

It could also result from flames in house fires, auto accidents and ignition from improper use of flammable liquids. Scalds, too, would be in this category and are caused by contact with hot liquids, such as water, oil, grease or tar. Consider that most coffee when first brewed reaches 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Contact with water at 140 degrees Fahrenheit for three seconds will create a deep burn. Chemical burns, meanwhile, are typically caused by acids or alkali substances, often in industrial accidents. One may also suffer chemical burns through inhalation of toxic fumes, steam or smoke. Electrical burns also often result from industrial accidents, resulting from contact with damaged electrical cords, electrical outlets or high-voltage wires.

These types of injuries often require a very long recovery period due to melted skin, damaged tissue and severe nerve damage. Catastrophic burn injury survivors will incur mounting medical expenses that often persist for many years and may not be covered fully by insurance. In partial thickness burns, blisters will likely be present and involve the entire epidermis (outer layer of the skin) and dermis (the thick under layer of the skin containing the nerve endings and hair follicles). These burns are red and wet in appearance and will be very painful. These heal without skin grafting but some minimal scarring can result. In full thickness burns, the epidermis is ravaged and most of the dermis is affected. These burns require surgical removal of burned tissue and skin grafting is performed to begin the healing process. By far the most serious of these injuries, third degree burns always require immediate medical attention.

Second-Degree Burns: This type of burn damages the first two layers of skin. These burns can be superficial or deep, depending on the severity of the burn. Second-degree burns result in pain, redness, swelling, and blistering, and can be treated with antibiotic creams prescribed by a doctor. Third-Degree Burns: These burns affect all the layers of skin and the tissue under it. These burns are severe and require medical treatment.

Fourth-degree burns are similar to third-degree burns, but they represent an even more dangerous level of injury. With this type of burn, the damage may extend past the skin and into the muscles and bone. This burn may cause so much damage that healing is not a possibility. Fourth-degree burns often require amputation. Even if a victim fully recovers, the damaged skin usually does not heal back to its original appearance.

You may be most familiar with the traditional burn classification of first, second, and third-degree burns. First-degree burns are usually mild. They affect only the outer layer of skin (epidermis). The skin is likely to be red, and there may be some pain and swelling. Most sunburns are first-degree burns. Second-degree burns injure the second layer (dermis) of skin. The skin will be intensely red and may develop blisters. These burns are often very painful. Third-degree burns involve all the layers of skin. Fat, nerves, muscles, and even bone may be burned.

In some cases, burn victims may be placed in an oxygen-rich, high-pressure room known as a hyperbaric chamber. Despite the best possible treatment, however, the damage to the skin is so extensive from a third-degree burn that the affected areas will never return to their normal state. Instead, scar tissue will eventually begin to form and cover the burned area unless a skin graft is performed. Skin grafts in which tissue from other parts of the patient\u2019s body are transplanted to the injury are typically permanent, but those in which the skin comes from another person or a donor animal are usually a temporary means of protecting the damaged area during the long, slow healing process."}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2023-06", "text": "destroyed. A superficial second-degree burn involves heat injury to the upper third of the dermis. The microvessels perfusing this area are injured, and permeability is increased, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of plasma into the interstitium. This fluid lifts off the thin, heat-destroyed epidermis, causing blister formation. Despite loss of the entire basal layer of the epidermis, a burn of this depth will heal in 7 to 14 days. A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance. A zone of ischemia is present between the dead superficial tissue and the deeper living tissue. This marginally viable tissue can be readily converted to nonviable tissue by infection or a further decrease in blood flow.

Burns can vary in severity from mild to life-threatening. Most burns only affect the uppermost layers of skin, but depending on the depth of the burn, underlying tissues can also be affected. Traditionally, burns are characterized by degree, with first degree being least severe and third degree being most. However, a more precise classification system referring to the thickness or depth of the wound is now more commonly used. For the sake of this article, burns will be described by thickness. For a comparison of the two classification systems, see the table below. When the epidermis and dermis are both destroyed and the burn extends down into the subcutaneous tissue, including fat, muscles and even bones, this is referred to as a full-thickness burn (third- and fourth degree burn). For full-thickness burns, generally the skin will either be white, black, brown, charred, or leathery in appearance. Often eschar (dry, black necrotic tissue) will form around the wound. Since nerve endings are destroyed along with the dermis, these wounds are typically painless. However, most full-thickness wounds are surrounded by wounds of various thicknesses, so these areas may still be painful. Infection: One of the main functions of the skin is to act as a barrier against outside infection. However, this physical barrier is broken with partial or full thickness wounds. With severe burns, hard, avascular eschar forms, providing an environment prone to microbial growth. In addition, eschar makes it more difficult for antibodies"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "and the texture of the skin may also be leathery or waxy. Fourth-Degree Burns: Fourth-degree burns destroy all skin layers and extend into muscle, tendon, or bone 7). Burn depth and size are important factors in determining whether a burn can be classified as minor, and are crucial in dictating the initial steps of burn assessment and management 8). Superficial burns can often be managed on an outpatient basis, whereas full-thickness burns must be evaluated by a specialist for possible excision and grafting. Determination of burn depth can be complicated by the conversion of burns to a higher burn category within the first several days. Conversion occurs when the damaged skin continues to spread and burn depth increases because of thermal injury that did not fully present on initial assessment; therefore, frequent evaluation and reassessment are necessary for all categories of burns 9). Burn size is determined by estimating the percentage of the patient\u2019s body surface area that is covered by partial-thickness and full-thickness burns (Figure 9) 11). First-degree burns are not incorporated into formal estimations of burn size. The Lund-Browder classification can be used for initial assessment of burn size in adults or children.

The practice of classifying burns in \u2018degrees\u2019 was introduced in the 18th century. Two German surgeons, Heister (1724) and Richter (1788) classified burns into four degrees: First degree: Heat, pain and small blisters. Second degree: Severe pain and large blisters. Third degree: Damage to the skin and underlying flesh, with crust formation. Fourth degree: Damage to all soft tissues down to the bone. In 19th century, Guillaume Dupuytren developed a classification of burn depth after a review of the care of 50 patients. This classification divided burns into the following six degrees: First degree: Erythema. Second degree: Skin inflammation with epidermal detachment. Third degree: Partial destruction of the papillary layer and subpapillary network of the corium. Fourth degree: Destruction of the skin down to the subcuticular layer. Fifth degree: Crust formation over skin and muscle. Dupuytren\u2019s classification is still in use by some today.[39] However many modern writings tend to use a simpler three degree classification system and this may be attributed to a French surgeon, Boyer, and was introduced in the beginning of the 18th century (1814).[40] This classification divided burns into the following three degrees: Second degree: Blistering of the skin leading to superficial ulceration. Third degree: Tissue disorganization leading to a dry yellow crust.

When you ask about fire injuries many people automatically and exclusively turn to burns. While burns are a very common injury, there are other injuries that can be just as severe and have an equally detrimental impact on a persons\u2019 life. There are two types of burns from fires: flash burns and burns from flames. Flash burns result from a sudden intense heat, which usually result from some form of explosion. Generally, people who have sustained flash burns can be treated as an outpatient and do not require extensive medical care. On the other hand, those who suffer burns from flames may incur extensive damage depending on the severity of the burn. There are four widely accepted burn types, which are separated by degrees. First-degree burns affect only the top layer of skin, which is known as the epidermis. In these burn types the skin is usually red and painful, however, this burn is usually equivalent to a sunburn and the healing process normally does not take longer than 3-5 days. Second-degree burns can be classified as either partial or full thickness burns and are more severe than first degree burns. In a partial thickness burn, there can be a blister that involved the entire skin and upper layers of the skin known as the dermis.

For deep partial-thickness burns, tissue may undergo spontaneous epithelialization from the few viable epithelial appendages at this deepest layer of dermis and heal within 3-6 weeks (if no infection arises). Because these burns have less capacity for re-epithelializing, a greater potential for hypertrophic scar formation exists. In deep partial-thickness burns, treatment with topical antimicrobial dressings is necessary to prevent infection as the burn wound heals. Contraction across joints, with resulting limitation in range of motion, is a common sequela. Splash scalds often cause second-degree burns. Third-degree burns Third-degree burns are full-thickness burns that destroy both epidermis and dermis. The capillary network of the dermis is completely destroyed. Burned skin has a white or leathery appearance with underlying clotted vessels and is anesthetic. Unless a third-degree burn is small enough to heal by contraction (< 1 cm), skin grafting always is necessary to resurface the injured area. Immersion scalds, flame burns, and chemical and high-voltage electrical injuries cause third-degree burns. Fourth-degree burns Fourth-degree burns cause full-thickness destruction of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with involvement of the underlying fascia, muscle, bone, or other structures.

Recently, a new system has come into use. This new system completely abandons the old use of degrees and describes the injuries based specifically by the depth of the burn.

This causes the muscles in the leg to contract and pull the toe away from the source of injury (6). At the same time, the dorsal horn sends another impulse up the spinal cord to the brain. During this trip, the impulse travels between nerve cells. When the impulse reaches a nerve ending (7), the nerve releases chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which carry the message to the adjacent nerve. When the impulse reaches the brain (8), it is analyzed and processed as an unpleasant physical and emotional sensation. Types of burns The Ayat under discussion mentions the burning of the skin. The severity of a burn depends on its depth, its extent, and the age of the victim. Burns are classified by depth as first, second, and third degree. First-degree burns cause redness and pain (e.g., sunburn). Second-degree burns are marked by blisters (e.g., scald by hot liquid). In third-degree burns, both the epidermis and dermis (external and internal parts of the skin) are destroyed, and underlying tissue may also be damaged. Further burn in the skin would damage the pain receptors and hence the person would not feel pain. Word Analysis: Quran rightly mentions this \u2018extreme\u2019 stage for the change of skin. The Arabic word used is \u0646\u0636\u062c\u062a which indicates the burning to the extreme stage. Ibn e Faris says that its basic meaning includes burning something to the last stage.

Skin may be charred or blackened and, because nerve damage is extensive, a victim who survives may feel no pain. Third- and fourth-degree burns or less-severe burns that cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks or a major joint are medical emergencies, the Mayo Clinic says. Less-severe burns require medical treatment if they have not healed after several weeks, or if the victim experiences an increase in pain, swelling or redness, or a discharge in the burned area.

Road rash is a term that refers to the skin abrasions that occur when someone hits pavement or other surfaces, and skin scrapes across it. It is common in motorcycle accidents, especially if the rider wasn\u2019t wearing protective clothing or if the accident was particularly severe.

Its severity is even classified in much the same way as burns. What are the different severities of road rash? Road rash is classified as first-, second- or third-degree injuries like burns. A first-degree road rash injury is minor and does not require much treatment other than cleaning it, if it requires any treatment at all. Second-degree burns penetrate deeper into the skin and may require a thorough cleaning to remove any debris from the wound.

TYPES OF BURN INJURIES The CDC explains that there are three different types of burn injuries: First-degree burns: these burns affect the top layer of the skin, and they are often red and painful to touch. In most cases, first-degree burns can heal properly with home treatment, but it is important to seek medical attention in cases where there are first-degree burns over large areas of the body, or cases where a very old or very young person has suffered the burn. Sunburns are a type of first-degree burn. Second-degree burns: this type of burn injury affects the first two layers of the skin, or epidermis. In addition to pain and redness, second-degree burns often result in blisters and some loss of skin.

When the impulse reaches a nerve ending (7), the nerve releases chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which carry the message to the adjacent nerve. When the impulse reaches the brain (8), it is analyzed and processed as an unpleasant physical and emotional sensation. Types of burns The Ayat under discussion mentions the burning of the skin. The severity of a burn depends on its depth, its extent, and the age of the victim. Burns are classified by depth as first, second, and third degree. First-degree burns cause redness and pain (e.g., sunburn). Second-degree burns are marked by blisters (e.g., scald by hot liquid). In third-degree burns, both the epidermis and dermis (external and internal parts of the skin) are destroyed, and underlying tissue may also be damaged.

A superficial second-degree burn involves heat injury to the upper third of the dermis. The microvessels perfusing this area are injured, and permeability is increased, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of plasma into the interstitium. This fluid lifts off the thin, heat-destroyed epidermis, causing blister formation. Despite loss of the entire basal layer of the epidermis, a burn of this depth will heal in 7 to 14 days. A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance. A zone of ischemia is present between the dead superficial tissue and the deeper living tissue.

Inpatient admission (episode 1):** The patient was admitted with burns of her right hand and fingers, including thumb, up to the wrist. She had reached into hot water, not realizing the temperature, while canning on her farm. She was taken to surgery, where an excisional debridement of the burns was carried out to prepare the wound for the graft. A split-thickness skin graft was applied over the dorsum and volar aspects of the hand. The postoperative recovery was without infection or other complication. **Discharge diagnosis:** Second- and third-degree burns, right hand and fingers (3 percent of total body surface burned, 2 percent affected by third degree). **Physician office visit (episode 2):** Both the burns and the surgical site on this woman's hand seem to be healing nicely. There was no evidence of infection. The area was rebandaged. Antibiotics were continued, and she was to return the following week. **Diagnosis:** Second- and third-degree burns, right hand and fingers.

This type of classification, which has been used with only minor alterations for nearly two hundred years, is concerned chiefly with the intensity of burning and not with the depth of tissue destroyed. Only recently have burn physicians come to realize that the depth of injury is of greater importance than superficial appearance. The classification of burns that has recently been adopted has completely forsaken all reference to outward appearances, which are only an indication of the severity of surface burning. The new type of classification recognizes two degrees of burn injury. The first new classification is partial thickness skin loss, implying the presence of sufficient living epithelial elements to resurface the area. The second new classification is full-thickness skin loss, implying virtually complete destruction of all epithelial elements so that healing can only occur by contraction of the wound and epithelial cell migration from the edge of the wound or by surgical intervention. Proper treatment depends on the correct classification of the burn. Further, early differentiation between these two degrees of burns is critical for several reasons.

In deep second-degree burns, excision of the remaining portion of the skin and application of a skin graft do not produce long-term results superior to those achieved with spontaneous healing. Therefore, the treatment of deep second-degree burns should be similar to that of superficial second-degree burns. Third-Degree Burns Third-degree burns involve the entire epidermis, dermis, and a portion of the subcutaneous region. These burns result in waxy dry regions often having a nontender central area, caused by burning of the neural tissue. Third-degree burns should be treated with excision within the first 3\u20137 days and a split-thickness skin graft applied to the involved areas. Fourth-Degree Burns In addition to involvement of the skin, fourth-degree burns involve deep tissues, including muscle, tendon, and bone.

For purpose of cremation, a human body has to be incinerated for one and half hours at 1000oC. The ashes weigh 2 to 3 kg., and contain bone fragments which can be identified as human. The duration of exposure: The symptoms are more severe if the heat is applied for a long time. The extent of the surface: The estimation of the surface area of the body involved is usually worked out by the \u201crule of nine\u201d, 9% for the head and each upper limb; 9% for the front of each lower limb; 9% for the front of chest; 9% for the back of chest; 9% for the front of the abdomen; and 9% for the back of abdomen, 99% of the body. The remaining 1% is for the external genitalia. Involvement of 50 percent of the body surface will prove fatal even when the burns are only of the first degree.

They cause deep dermal or full-thickness burns with the outline corresponding to the shape of the hot object. The lesion appears blackened, is minimally painful, and frequently requires surgical intervention. Q. How are scald injuries classified in children, on the basis of body surface area and depth? The severity of scalds is assessed on the basis of depth (or layers of skin involved) and size, or the percentage of TBSA affected. Wilson's classification as first-, second-, and third-degree or superficial, partial thickness or full-thickness burns is similar in children and adults.

Generally, the burn is classified according to the depth: Superficial (first-degree) only involves skin epidermis; Superficial partial-thickness (superficial second-degree) involves superficial dermis; Deep partial-thickness (deep second-degree) involves the deeper dermis; Full-thickness (third-degree) includes the whole layer of epidermis and dermis, reaching the subcutaneous tissue, and even muscles and bones are damaged. 9"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2022-05", "text": "day 14.

Keywords: Topical Vitamin C Solution; Granulation; Wound; Burn Skin burns are among the most important challenge in medicine and remain a major public health issue worldwide (1). Skin injuries occur due to chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity, and boiled water (2, 3). Acute thermal injuries requiring medical treatment affect nearly half a million Americans each year, with approximately 40,000 hospitalizations and 3,400 deaths annually (4). First-degree burn affects the epidermis. Superficial second-degree burns involve damage that penetrates into the papillary dermis. Deep second-degree burns involve damage extending beyond the reticular dermis. Burns that destroy all layers of the skin down to the subcutaneous fat are third-degree burns (5). First- and superficial second-degree burns heal almost without scars, while deep second-degree and third-degree burn lead to the formation of hypertrophic scars during the healing process, and patients often require reconstructive surgery (6). Wound healing is divided into three phases: inflammation, re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation, and matrix formation and remodeling. The phases of wound repair overlap considerably. Inflammation is divided into early and late phases, denoting neutrophil-rich and mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates, respectively. Wound contraction begins after the granulation tissue is well-established, and"}, {"title": "rpj-book", "text": "anything but their survival.

Still deeper burns required fasciotomies (incising the fascia that divides muscle compartments, to allow swollen muscle tissue to expand). For some, the deepest burns would even necessitate limb amputations.

Burn healing can be regarded as a particular kind of wound healing and most of the skin reactions are the similar. The conditions for burn healing differ according to the depth of the burn wound in addition to several factors can interfere with the healing process. Consequently three zones have been known in a burn, an inner zone (coagulation zone) where cell damage is irreversible, a middle zone (statis zone) where damage is severe and an outer zone (hyperemic zone) where recovery is likely [15]. Moreover there are three degrees of burns, the first in which the epidermis only is damaged, the second where some dermal damage also occurs but where epithelial regeneration is possible and the third where both epidermis and dermis are irreversibly damaged. 1 st and 2 nd degree burns are known together as partial thickness burns. 2 nd degree burns is the deeper injury than 1 st degree burn. It involves all the epidermis and much of the corium. The deep dermal burn is of important clinical importance. Most 2 nd degree burns are characterized by blisters. They are usually accompanied by considerable subcutaneous oedema. The rate of healing is dependent upon the depth of skin destruction on whether or not presence of infection. In superficial partial thickness burns, healing usually takes place uneventfully in a period of 10 to 14 days unless infection supervenes.

At the macro level, we see three concentric circles developing around the wound after cutaneous burns, ranging from interior to exterior and termed the zone of necrosis, the zone of stasis and the zone of hyperemia . The microcirculation in the zone of stasis is characterized by the formation of progressive microthrombus. The location of the zone of stasis varies according to the depth of the burns. Burns affecting dermis are termed second-degree burns while third-degree burns involve the full-thickness of skin as well as subcutaneous tissues. The ultimate burn depth is determined by the development of the stasis zone, which may extend full-thickness, arresting blood circulation and causing tissue necrosis resulting in third-degree burn. However, if there is some improvement in the microcirculation in the zone of stasis, deep second-degree burns will rarely deteriorate into third-degree burns. BRT was designed to deal with the zone of stasis by improving the microcirculation, avoiding the formation of microthrombus and thereby arresting progressive necrosis. Recent research suggests that significant release of vascular active factors in plasma, endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO), has a close correlation with the deterioration of vulnerable tissue within the zone of stasis during the early postburn stage[2-4].

Thermal burn causes not only a small or local injury which can be treated at home or outpatient but also the severe and fatal injuries which require the in-hospital treatment.

The extent of burn is estimated through total body surface area burn (% TBSA) whereas the depth of burn is estimated by the deep extent of injury into the epidermis or dermis.

It entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an object's temperature. Other mechanisms are convection and conduction. Radiation heat transfer is characteristically different from the other two in that it does not require a medium and, in fact it reaches maximum efficiency in a vacuum. Electromagnetic radiation has some proper characteristics depending on the frequency and wavelengths of the radiation. The phenomenon of radiation is not yet fully understood. Two theories have been used to explain radiation; however neither of them is perfectly satisfactory. First, the earlier theory which originated from the concept of a hypothetical medium referred as ether. Ether supposedly fills all evacuated or non-evacuated spaces. The transmission of light or of radiant heat are allowed by the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the ether.[11] Electromagnetic waves have similar characteristics to television and radio broadcasting waves they only differ in wavelength.[12] All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed; therefore, shorter"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "This clinical study was undertaken to test the efficacy of topical Sucralfate Cream in second and third degree burns.

The first phase comprised 60 patients, 30 of whom were treated with Sucralfate Cream while the other 30 were treated with other topical antimicrobial agents. Twenty-one of the patients in the study group had second-degree burns and nine patients' third degree burns. In the second phase, a double blind study was carried out on 25 patients where one area of burns was treated with Sucralfate Cream while another control area of the same patient was treated with a placebo ointment, containing the excipients used during preparation of the Sucralfate Cream, without Sucralfate. In the first phase, it was seen that the period of epithelialisation of second degree burns in the study group treated with Sucralfate Cream was 18.8 days compared with 24.6 days with other topical agents. This difference is statistically significant with a P value of <0.00001. In the double blind study, also healing in the areas treated with Sucralfate was more rapid than those treated with bland placebo ointment.

In this work, the use of surface skin temperature for the determination of the depth of second-degree burns is explored. An analytical solution of the 3D Pennes steady-state equation is obtained assuming that the ratio between burn depth and the burn size is small.

This results in the three categories of thermal burn injuries, including first degree burns which are primarily confined to the epidermis, second degree burns which extend to some extent into the underlying dermis, and the third degree burns (or full thickness burn) which involves the entire dermis.

Conclusions: Topical administration of a vitamin C solution could be effective in promoting the healing of second-degree burn wounds. Keywords: Topical Vitamin C Solution; Granulation; Wound; Burn Skin burns are among the most important challenge in medicine and remain a major public health issue worldwide (1). Skin injuries occur due to chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity, and boiled water (2, 3). Acute thermal injuries requiring medical treatment affect nearly half a million Americans each year, with approximately 40,000 hospitalizations and 3,400 deaths annually (4). First-degree burn affects the epidermis. Superficial second-degree burns involve damage that penetrates into the papillary dermis. Deep second-degree burns involve damage extending beyond the reticular dermis. Burns that destroy all layers of the skin down to the subcutaneous fat are third-degree burns (5). First- and superficial second-degree burns heal almost without scars, while deep second-degree and third-degree burn lead to the formation of hypertrophic scars during the healing process, and patients often require reconstructive surgery (6). Wound healing is divided into three phases: inflammation, re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation, and matrix formation and remodeling. The phases of wound repair overlap considerably. Inflammation is divided into early and late phases, denoting neutrophil-rich and mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates, respectively.

Most people can recover from burns without serious health consequences, depending on the cause and degree of injury. More serious burns need direct emergency medical care to avoid of complications and death. Three primary types of burns are called: first, second, and third degree. Each degree is based on the harshness of injury to the skin, with first degree is the most minor and third-degree is the most severe.

H&E stained images showed that the impaired regions were filled with newly migrated cells, which may be transplanted cells or activated endogenous stem cells. Furthermore, GFP-labeled cell tracing showed that transplanted cells were involved in functional SG repair regeneration in second-degree burn wounds but epidermis repair in third-degree burn wounds. These results strongly correspond with our immunofluorescence analysis of specific SG protein expression. Given the different traits between second- and third-degree burn wounds, we hypothesized that environmental signals play an indispensable role in the therapeutic efficacy of inductive SGCs in burn mice. Although these results are shown in the present study, the effects of inductive SGCs on SG regeneration were only examined in burn wounds. Future studies, with different methods according to the different kinds of wound, are required to better determine if environmental signals of wounds lead to the limited therapeutic efficacy of inductive SGCs. In summary, we have provided evidence that IRF6 expression along with SG development and Irf6 is sufficient to direct the SG specification of EPs in vitro. In addition, the inductive SGCs could repair SG both structurally and functionally in second-degree burn wounds, but they had limited regenerative capability in three-degree burn wounds.

First degree burns are visually indicated by redness and blistering of the skin. Second degree burns are visually indicated by withering of the skin without charring. Third degree burns are visually indicated by eschar formation and charring. This type of classification, which has been used with only minor alterations for nearly two hundred years, is concerned chiefly with the intensity of burning and not with the depth of tissue destroyed. Only recently have burn physicians come to realize that the depth of injury is of greater importance than superficial appearance. The classification of burns that has recently been adopted has completely forsaken all reference to outward appearances, which are only an indication of the severity of surface burning. The new type of classification recognizes two degrees of burn injury. The first new classification is partial thickness skin loss, implying the presence of sufficient living epithelial elements to resurface the area. The second new classification is full-thickness skin loss, implying virtually complete destruction of all epithelial elements so that healing can only occur by contraction of the wound and epithelial cell migration from the edge of the wound or by surgical intervention. Proper treatment depends on the correct classification of the burn. Further, early differentiation between these two degrees of burns is critical for several reasons. It is better to excise dead tissue and close the wound than to allow spontaneous separation of the slough, with its attendant risks of infection, fibrosis, and loss of function.

In all age groups, tap water scalds are the second most common cause of burn injuries. Elderly loved ones, however, are at a greater risk for scalding than other populations for a variety of reasons. The Burn Foundation says that hot water causes third-degree burns in one second at 156 degrees F, in two seconds at 149 degrees F, in five seconds at 140 degrees F, and in 15 seconds at 133 degrees F. Scalding is a second-degree burn that is deep and results in splitting of skin layers and/or blistering. The solution would seem to be to simply decrease the water temperature; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) manual on Legionnaire\u2019s disease (a potentially fatal infectious disease) says differently, however. Water is to be stored at a minimum of 140 degrees F, but can be delivered at a minimum of 122 degrees F to ensure harmful bacteria are killed. A caregiver must first recognize the level of risk their loved one has for scalding, and also know ways to prevent unnecessary burns, while maintaining a safe water temperature. The number one risk an elderly person has for scalding is simply a decreased reaction time. Many seniors will unknowingly subject themselves to the danger of severe burns and realize it too late.

Comparison between the treated groups showed that burn wound treated with quercetin significantly increased healing potential than the rutin treated MSCs. Histological findings showed enhanced regeneration of skin layers along with hair follicles in the quercetin group, while increased neovascularization was noted in both treatment groups. Gene profile of wound healing mediators illustrated significant upregulation of IL-5, IL-4, GPX-7, TXNRD-2, PRDX, VEGF, and FGF and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-6. Introduction Skin functions as a bacterial, physical and chemical barrier to protect the body against harsh external environment. Any damage to the skin can be devastating and should be recovered efficiently. Skin possesses the ability to regenerate itself after any trauma, through mediated interactions between cells and healing mediators, which triggers healing mechanisms to restore damages [1]. Each layer of skin performs a specialized function; epidermis regulates body temperature, dermis maintains structural integrity and assists in sensation, and hypodermis provides mechanical protection and thermoregulation [2]. Increase in the number of burn wound injuries is a challenge for the healthcare system because of the failure to manage the condition in a timely and systematic way. Burn injuries are classified as first, second, third, and fourth degree burns, based on the depth of penetration of injury and extent of tissue destruction. First and second degree burns are superficial, while third and fourth degree burns are deep wounds [3]. In a clinical setting, diagnoses of burn patients are based on total body surface area (TBSA) affected with the wound. Minor burns are first"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "humans skin explants submitted to experimental burn injury. Introduction Burns, irrespective of their severity level, are one of the most common causes of accidental injuries worldwide [1][2][3][4]. In first-degree burns, only the superficial layers of the epidermis are affected, allowing tissue repair via the mobilization of the keratinocyte stem cells and progenitors residing in the basal layer [5]. As a result, first-degree burns heal spontaneously without scar formation and do not require any treatment other than a topical moisturizer [6]. In contrast, third-degree burns do not heal spontaneously and require surgical intervention to cover wounds (autografts, allografts, epidermal sheets) [5,7]. Although current treatments have greatly increased the survival rate of patients suffering from extended third-degree burns [8], it is estimated that burns cause 180,000 deaths per year according to a recent report of the World Health Organization. In addition to being potentially fatal, severe skin burns may result in long-term functional and/or aesthetic complications [9], notably when the healing process is hampered by secondary infections and abnormal tissue remodeling. [3]. Finally, superficial partial-thickness (superficial second-degree) burns spontaneously heal within a time period of 7 to 14 days post-burn, as there are still mitotically active stem cells in the basal layer. On the other hand, deep second-degree burns destroy the entire epidermis, including the cells of the basal layer, and result in the formation of a scar. Delayed complications may occur during the healing process of deep second-degree burns requiring then the use of surgical treatments [6,7].

Liebeck attempted to remove the lid of the coffee cup in order to put cream and sugar in the coffee. The car was stopped. As she was removing the lid, the contents of the 180-190 degree liquid spilled on her. Liebeck suffered burns on her inner thighs, buttocks, and groin areas.

Coffee that is of the temperature spilled on Liebeck is hot enough to cause third degree burns in two to seven seconds. In other words, the coffee served at McDonald\u2019s was far too hot.

Burn healing can be regarded as a particular kind of wound healing and most of the skin reactions are the similar. The conditions for burn healing differ according to the depth of the burn wound in addition to several factors can interfere with the healing process. Consequently three zones have been known in a burn, an inner zone (coagulation zone) where cell damage is irreversible, a middle zone (statis zone) where damage is severe and an outer zone (hyperemic zone) where recovery is likely [15]. Moreover there are three degrees of burns, the first in which the epidermis only is damaged, the second where some dermal damage also occurs but where epithelial regeneration is possible and the third where both epidermis and dermis are irreversibly damaged. 1 st and 2 nd degree burns are known together as partial thickness burns. 2 nd degree burns is the deeper injury than 1 st degree burn. It involves all the epidermis and much of the corium. The deep dermal burn is of important clinical importance. Most 2 nd degree burns are characterized by blisters. They are usually accompanied by considerable subcutaneous oedema. The rate of healing is dependent upon the depth of skin destruction on whether or not presence of infection. In superficial partial thickness burns, healing usually takes place uneventfully in a period of 10 to 14 days unless infection supervenes.

Burns were classified as first degree, second degree, third degree, or fourth degree depending on their severity and extent of penetration into the skin.

The crime is different, and so is the punishment. A defendant will be accused of third-degree murder if they unintentionally kill someone else while doing something dangerous. There has to be no intent to kill the person. Pennsylvania, Florida, and Minnesota call this third-degree murder; most other states call it manslaughter. What Is the Difference Between Third-Degree Murder and First or Second-Degree Murder? First-degree murder requires premeditation or for the death to have occurred whilst committing a felony. Some states classify felony murder as first-degree murder and others as second-degree murder. Second-degree murder is an intentional murder in the heat of the moment, so not premeditated. If the defendant planned to commit bodily harm and unintentionally killed the person, then this is second-degree murder in most states. The terms first, second, and third-degree murder are not used in all states, and the definitions vary between states. As we have already mentioned, most states call third-degree murder manslaughter. What Is The Difference Between Third-Degree Murder and Manslaughter? Manslaughter is considered a less serious crime than murder in the eyes of the law. Most states classify the crime as manslaughter if the death was unintentional but could have been avoided if the defendant acted appropriately. In some states, they classify manslaughter with different degrees, similar to murder; others will just classify it as voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter.

These can require topical antibiotics and even surgery to remove dead tissue or a graft to cover damaged skin with healthy tissue. \"A third-degree burn damages the skin in its entirety,\" Chestovich said. Such burns can require multiple surgeries and leave lasting scars. Fourth-degree pavement burns -- which hit muscle, deep tissue and bone -- are rare but not unheard of. \"We have seen hot pavement cause fourth-degree burns in cases when there was extended contact, usually a person lying unconscious on pavement for an extended period of time,\" Chestovich said. It appears that pavement burns may be becoming more common. The Lions Burn Care Center has seen an increase in recent years, but it's not clear why. It could be due to gradually rising temperatures, but also might simply owe to a population increase, Chestovich said. If you suffer a pavement burn, Chestovich cautioned against self-treating with cold water or ice, which could make matters worse.

By depth Currently, burns are described according to the depth of injury to the dermis and are loosely classified into first, second, third and fourth degrees. This system was devised by the French barber-surgeon Ambroise Pare and remains in use today.[7] It is often difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn. This is especially so in the case of second degree burns, which can continue to evolve over time. As such, a second-degree partial-thickness burn can progress to a third-degree burn over time even after initial treatment. Distinguishing between the superficial-thickness burn and the partial-thickness burn is important, as the former may heal spontaneously, whereas the latter often requires surgical excision and skin grafting.

Depending on the degree of sunburn, over a period of four to seven days, the erythematous skin begins to either fade or blister and peel. Sunburns, like other burns, can be categorized by degrees, depending on their depth. (See Table 5.) First-degree sunburns are pink or red, painful to the touch, and limited to the epidermis. Second-degree burns can be categorized further depending on whether they are superficial or deep partial-thickness. The superficial second-degree burns form blisters, are erythematous, painful, and blanch upon palpation. This wound is limited to the superficial dermis. Conversely, deep second-degree partial-thickness burns range between white and erythematous areas, with areas that blanch less, and extend throughout the epidermis into the dermis. Although a third-degree sunburn occurs rarely, it appears stiff and white or tan, does not blanch at all, and is painless, compared to the first- and second-degree burns.

For some purposes, scattering and reflection at the surface can also be neglected for LW radiation. Additional notes and observations of scattering of solar radiation: When there is a hole through which direct solar rays pass, scattering along the path of the beam allows the beam to glow with scattered radiation - it can be seen from outside itself. This can be observed in a dusty room with sunlight coming through a window. A shadow cast through the air can also be seen from outside itself by the same mechanism. Variations in direct solar ray intensity can be seen to the extent that they have optical thickness along the line of sight and there is not too much optical thickness along the line of sight between the viewer and variation being observed. These variations are called crepescular rays and can be seen when the direct sun is blocked by a layer of clouds with holes, or there are patches of clouds casting shadows, or when the sun is behind a cloud with an irregular edge. One particularly interesting case is the shadow cast be a long thin straight contrail (the cloud left by a jet when conditions allow).

But as always, there is science that can account for a solution. To that end, architects at the London-based firm NBBJ have come up with the notion of what can be termed as shadow-less buildings.

Of course, beyond just a concept, such an idea needs some details and complexity \u2013 so as to maintain the sunlight reflection mode during most time of the day.

This building would reflect the light onto the shadow formed by its southern counterpart \u2013 and, the specific curve of its glass surface would maintain the alignment of reflection all throughout the day.

Perhaps a rising thunderstorm on the far side of a cloud layer might throw things totally out of whack but there's not a lot of thermal energy to feed those in Scandinavia so they wouldn't be as common as, e.g. here in Florida.

Many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways, including multiple-vehicle collisions. The aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve. A solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in World War II was called Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). It involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog, allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft. The high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations. Shadows Shadows are cast through fog in three dimensions. The fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree, but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on.

Wielding a kitchen colander and a sifter, retired Grade 2 teacher Anna Werbowy of Mississauga demonstrated how to cast tiny shadows onto a surface below. \u201cI was watching the live broadcast about the eclipse and there was a young scientist interviewed,\u201d she said. The scientist suggested using the kitchen apparatus, but Werbowy wasn\u2019t entirely sure how to do it. As she walked through the CNE, she stopped a group of young scientists and asked them if it would really work. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Sure, that would work!\u2019\u201d she said, laughing. Together, they figured out how to use the equipment to cast shadows of \u201clittle moons, instead of a hole\u201d"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Shadows,\u201d we\u2019ll be able to speak of photos of the event horizon of a black hole.

Description: In recent years, we have learned that the commonplace materials described by the scientific findings we have so far discovered portray but a tiny piece of a much greater universe\u2013a universe ruled by vast mysteries that appear to shape reality at both its largest and smallest sizes. That universe is now coming to be better understood. You will see how this has happened and how the shadows in the unknown slowly continue to be lit and identified. Reality in the Shadows is a chronicle of the men and women who cast light on these mysteries of our existence, a look into some of the brilliant ideas that they presented, and a longer look at the new and even greater mysteries of the cosmos that"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "The earth and the moon cast their shadows leading to the phenomena of eclipses. At times, the sun, the earth and the moon come to lie in a straight line. The object in between casts a shadow and causes an eclipse. There are two kinds of eclipses, the lunar and solar eclipse. Lunar Eclipse The lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are in a straight line, with the earth in between the sun and the moon. The shadow of the earth is cast on the moon. If the moon is in the umbra cone of the earth, it will not be visible because the moon is non\u2013luminous and since it does not receive any light from the sun, it does not reflect any light. This is called a total lunar eclipse. If the moon is slightly out of line, it will not be completely in the umbra cone of the earth. It then receives some light from the sun which it reflects to the earth and makes itself partially visible. This is called a partial lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse can occur only on a full moon day. Solar Eclipse A solar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and the moon are in a straight line, with the moon between the sun and the earth. The shadow of the moon is cast on the earth. The portion of the earth falling completely in the umbra region has total solar eclipse. The sun appears as a black circular disc with a ring of light."}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "passengers but for photographers, this is a dream come true. Just think about all the images at the New York Central station where the sun is just merely entering the station through the windows. You can capture images like during the morning or evening when sun is at a lower angle again. For added effect, smoke works wonders with the light rays just passing in. Stations where you are allowed to vape an e-cigarette would be my favorite choice. So far, the sun was mostly the highlight of the scene itself. Creating a scene of high contrast needs the support of the sun as well, but is more built around the shadows and darker areas. Much like the normal shadow pictures, this time we can search for high buildings that are able to cast a massive shadow and leave only little light left to illuminate the scene. Another place where you can capture photos of high contrast is under bridges. Here you need to face the tunnel while the sun is diagonally behind your back. Search for the edges where the shadow begins to start and photograph the people as they are exiting the dark tunnel. Images like these almost look like you have used a flash, but instead, you utilized the natural contrast to create negative space in your photography.

This could be a silly question to ask, but I would like to know why is a gibbous moon shape possible. From the few cases I've drawn here, I could not think of a configuration where the Earth's shadow can be cast on the Moon in a way that leads to a gibbous shape of the bright part of Moon. In my diagrams, grey represents bright and black represents shadowed portions of the Moon (smaller circles, with the bigger circles being Earth). As for the order of the celestial bodies, the Sun is out of the screen, Earth is on the screen and the Moon is inside the screen. That could be a crude arrangement but it's the only one I can come up with to cast shadows, though I can accept the fact that there could be more complex 3-D arrangements. A: The shadow in a gibbous Moon is not caused by the Earth's shadow \u2500 Earth plays no role in that arrangement, beyond being the place where the observer sits. Instead, the shadow in a gibbous Moon is simply cast by the Moon itself. The correct arrangement is as follows: (With due apologies for the poor drawing quality.) This means, in particular, that your depiction of how the gibbous Moon looks like is incorrect: the terminator (i.e. the line between the illuminated and dark sides) is a meridian, and it passes (at least, modulo inclinations and so on) through the North and South poles. (This is true"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "parade. No flags. No fireworks. It was going to be hot for our hike out. Blazing sun and perspiration. But first we sit beside the mirror lake on our blue mats sipping tea and mocha, swallowed by the buzzing of a thousand insects. Pollinators. Clear sky, except for a few vague vapor trails drifting east. Later in that calm morning, a pattern of high cirrus would turn the vapor trails into wispy feathers. Dragonflies dance over the water, do-si-doing around each other, dropping to kiss the mirrored surface. Fish, some eight inches long, explode into our rarer medium like Olympians in training. Expanding rings pass through one another. Before the wind comes up. Before the beginning of time. I \"see\" their motion in the everyday moment. Just how wide is the present moment, in which all consciousness takes place? The rising sun casts long shadows. I do not \"see\" them move. With a shadow, it is different. To perceive the motion of a shadow, I must mark a leaf, a twig, a stone, and then look back a few moments later to see if the line between light and dark has advanced. This is not short-term memory. This does not arise in the \"present moment.\" The movement of shadows is a fabrication of the mind. Albert Einstein wrote, \"People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" Is this not the legacy of our larger brains?

At that point, the Moon can move into the shadow cast by Earth, resulting in a lunar eclipse. However, most of the time, the Moon\u2019s slightly tilted orbit brings it above or below Earth\u2019s shadow. The time period when the Moon, Earth and the Sun are lined up and on the same plane \u2013 allowing for the Moon to pass through Earth\u2019s shadow \u2013 is called an eclipse season. Eclipse seasons last about 34 days and occur just shy of every six months. When a full moon occurs during an eclipse season, the Moon travels through Earth\u2019s shadow, creating a lunar eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses, which require special glasses to view and can be seen only for a few short minutes in a very limited area, a total lunar eclipse can be seen for about an hour by anyone on the nighttime side of Earth \u2013 as long as skies are clear. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon passes through two distinct parts of Earth\u2019s shadow. The outer part of the cone-shaped shadow is called the penumbra. The penumbra is less dark than the inner part of the shadow because it\u2019s penetrated by some sunlight. The inner part of the shadow, known as the umbra, is much darker because Earth blocks additional sunlight from entering the umbra. During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon first enters into the penumbra, or the outer part of Earth's shadow, where the shadow is still penetrated"}], "hoverinfo": "text"}, {"x": [0.09786628186702728,

If the direction is bent enough, the light that passes through the object will be angled out of the forward-traveling beam. As a result, the beam will have a dark spot; a shadow. Consider completely transparent objects such as glass cups, bottles of water, or the lenses of eyeglasses. Even though such transparent objects do not absorb or reflect very much light, they still interact with light through refraction. Refraction is what makes transparent cups visible to our eyes. Refraction also enables clear objects to cast shadows. Take off your eyeglasses and place them on the table at night under the illumination of a single lamp and you will see a distinct shadow caused by the transparent lenses. Although air is almost perfectly transparent, it can still cast shadows via refraction. The key principle regarding refraction is that light is bent when the index of refraction differs from one location to the next. Air and glass are different materials and have different indices of refraction. Light therefore bends when it goes from air into glass, such as at the surface of a glass lens. Refraction does not happen inside a glass lens because the material inside the lens is uniform.

But how can a piece of glass do this? The process is actually very simple. As light travels from one medium to another, it changes speed. Light travels more quickly through air than it does through glass, so a lens slows it down. When light waves enter a piece of glass at an angle, one part of the wave will reach the glass before another and so will start slowing down first. This is something like pushing a shopping cart from pavement to grass, at an angle. The right wheel hits the grass first and so slows down while the left wheel is still on the pavement. Because the left wheel is briefly moving more quickly than the right wheel, the shopping cart turns to the right as it moves onto the grass. The effect on light is the same -- as it enters the glass at an angle, it bends in one direction. It bends again when it exits the glass because parts of the light wave enter the air and speed up before other parts of the wave. In a standard converging, or convex lens, one or both sides of the glass curves out. This means rays of light passing through will bend toward the center of the lens on entry.

Ewald proves for random media like glass (and Oseen does the same for ordered media such as crystals), that the net result of all of those zillions of little excited light waves add up to zero in every direction but three.

Since the photon that comes out of glass is going in the exact same direction as the photon that went in, something very interesting is happening inside the glass. The photon reaches the glass and is immediately absorbed by an electron. Sometime later, the electron emits a new photon. The new photon is travelling in exactly the same direction as the old photon. The new photon is absorbed by the next electron, which later emits another photon, again travelling in the exact same direction. This process repeats billions of times until the final photon is ejected on the other side of the glass, still in the exact same direction, and goes on its way.

It can travel only about two-thirds as fast through a piece of glass as it can through empty space or air, and about three-quarters as fast through water as through air. This slowing down is important, as it makes it possible for us to bend beams of light, and thus to make prisms, lenses, eye-glasses, telescopes, microscopes, cameras and other devices that help us to see better. When a light ray moves from one substance to another so that its speed is changed, the ray changes direction. This is called refraction. There are some objects which do not reflect light, but permit it to pass through, while slowing it down somewhat, according to the density of the object. Water, which is denser than air, will slow the light velocity by about one-fourth, while glass which is more dense, will slow its speed of travel by one-third.

Therefore the amount of light that emerges on the other side, for a given angle of incidence, is independent of the thickness of the glass. Instead, some of the incident light is reflected from the first boundary as the light enters the glass, and some is reflected from the second boundary as it exits the glass.

Together the work of these two men is known as the Ewald-Oseen Extinction Theorem. What's so mysterious about how a window works. Isn't a window merely a sheet of glass?

If n is greater than 1, the light bends deeper into the material; if n is less than 1, the light bends towards the surface. In a vacuum the speed of light is equal to a constant c. But in material media, the velocity v of light is equal to: v = c/n. For visible light in glass, the refractive index is about 1.5, so light travels at about 70% of its vacuum speed: inside glass, light travels SLOW.

In fact, both statements are true and are not diametrically opposed. How so? Though the words refraction and reflection sound similar, there meanings are entirely different. Refraction occurs when light passes through a transparent material. Whereas, reflection occurs when it bounces off an opaque material. For light to refract it must pass through a medium different from the one it was travelling through. In space light travels at 100% because there is nothing to impede its progress. Its speed is reduced to 99.7% when it travels through air, and is further reduces to 75% when it travels through water. Because light waves slow down when passing through a denser medium, they bunch up. That is why if you place a pencil in a glass of water it appears to bend.

How does a piece of glass manage to reflect light from one side while remaining clear on the other? The secret is that it doesn't. A one-way mirror has a reflective coating applied in a very thin, sparse layer -- so thin that it's called a half-silvered surface. The name half-silvered comes from the fact that the reflective molecules coat the glass so sparsely that only about half the molecules needed to make the glass an opaque mirror are applied. At the molecular level, there are reflective molecules speckled all over the glass in an even film but only half of the glass is covered. The half-silvered surface will reflect about half the light that strikes its surface, while letting the other half go straight through. It turns out that half-silvered mirrors are also essential to many types of lasers -- see How Lasers Work for details. So why doesn't the \"criminal suspect\" see the detectives in the next room?

Light does bend due to gravity, but not in the formation of a rainbow.

This means there will be no phase shift at that reflection, since air has a lower index of refraction than either film. Before the separation, the second reflection within the plastic was off a faster medium (glass), so there is no change to the phase shift for the plastic, and the same interference as before (destructive) will result.

Actually I had asked in another post that \"Does infrared rays pass through active shutter glass\" but someone just commented that infrared rays dont pass through polarized glass. If infrared rays doesnt pass through polarized glass can someone explain the reason or give reference link to look through. A: Infra-red radiation will pass through a polarised medium just like visible light does i.e. the component at right angles to the plane of polarisation will be blocked. So there's nothing special about the fact the glasses are polarised. However most materials are only transparent over a restricted range of wavelengths. Optical glass only transmits light with a wavelength from about 300nm to around 2500nm. There's a good article on the optical properties of glass here. However I think passive 3D glasses are made from conventional polarisers, which are made from a polymer called polyvinyl alcohol. I struggled to find much about the spectra of PVA polarisers, though I found this article that lists some polarisers that work down to 3000nm. So it seems PVA polarisers will transmit at least the near infra-red. However the term infra-red covers a huge range of wavelengths from 750nm - 1mm. I can't think of anything, even air, that is transparent right across this range of wavelengths so everything absorbs infra-red light to some extent.

It passes through gases and through some liquids and some solids. The best of glass, though it is so solid, interposes very little hindrance to the passage of light.

A plate of alum permits light to pass, but stops both luminous heat and dark heat. Remember that transmitted heat, as was said of reflected heat, does not heat the body through which it passes.

Thus when light waves are passed through a diffraction slit, the resulting pattern is formed by the diffracted light rays constructively and destructively interfering with each other. Constructive and destructive interference of two waves by Haade - Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Commons When light is able to traverse through matter of some sort, perhaps its most useful behavior emerges. Refraction is the bending of light rays as they travel across the interface between two different materials, such as air and water. The cause of this behavior is that light travels at different speeds through different materials. It is well known that the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, and it doesn't slow down much when traveling through air. But light travels only 3/4 as fast through water and only 2/3 as fast through glass. The slower light travels through a substance, the more it will be bent through refraction. Snell's Law which describes refraction by Cristan - Public Domain via Commons Large portions of the science of optics largely proceed from the very simple rules of refraction. Because translucent materials such as glass bend light rays, we can create lenses that manipulate and focus the light that passes through them to serve various purposes. The lenses in eyeglasses, microscopes and telescopes all harness the refractory behavior of light, which is only possible because light observably behaves like all waves do.

The phase conjugate mirror reverses the distorted beam, and as it passes back through the glass it precisely retraces its steps and thus returns to its original undistorted form. The beam reflected from the phase conjugate mirror has the curious property that it encodes information for the original image in a distorted, unrecognizable form, and as time passes, the distortion is reduced and the information contained by the beam becomes clearly manifest. Normally, we expect to see just the opposite -- a pattern containing meaningful information will gradually degrade until the information is irretrievably lost. Thompson further elucidates the connection between the material and transcendental levels of existence with an example similar to that of optical phase conjugation. Suppose we have an arrangement in which pictures are being transmitted through a sheet of frosted glass. On one side of the glass we would see a series of images but we would not be able to determine the source of the images on the other side of the opaque glass. But in thinking about it, one would expect that the light coming through the frosted glass would become distorted.

We should all be familiar with reflection since we see bright reflections when a light hits a smooth shiny surface like a mirror. This is an example of light interacting with matter in a certain way. When light travels from one medium to another, the light bends. This is called refraction. If the medium, in the path of the light, bends the light or blocks certain frequencies of it, we can see separate colors. A rainbow, for example, occurs when the sun's light becomes separated by moisture in the air. The moisture bends the light, thus separating the frequencies and allowing us to see the unique colors of the light spectrum. Prisms also provide this effect. When light hits a prism at certain angles, the light will refract (bend), causing it to be separated into its individual frequencies. This effect occurs because of the shape of the prism and the angle of the light. If you look closely at what happens as the light wave enters the prism in the second diagram, you will notice that it bends down. This bending occurs because the light travels faster through the air than it does through the prism. When the lower portion of the wave enters the prism, it slows down.

This principle, named after Christiaan Huygens and Augustin-Jean Fresnel, is a method of analyzing the wave propagation patterns of light, especially in diffraction and refraction. It states that every unobstructed point on a wave-front emanates secondary spherical waves in all directions. Hence, the net light amplitude at a given point is the vector sum of all wave amplitudes at that point. This principle makes it very useful in visualizing what happens during light diffraction.

For a light beam passing through the mirror after multiple reflections, the position of the line-focus can be seen in the virtual image when observed from the light output side. Therefore, this light beam travels as if it originated at a virtual light source located at the position of the line-focus and diverged from the virtual light source. The positions of the virtual light sources for all the transmitted light beams automatically align along the normal to the glass plate with a constant spacing, that is, a number of virtual light sources are superimposed to create an optical phased array. Due to the interference of all the light beams, the phased array emits a collimated light beam in one direction, which is at a wavelength dependent angle, and therefore, an angular dispersion is produced. Wavelength resolution Similarly to the resolving power of a diffraction grating, which is determined by the number of the illuminated grating elements and the order of diffraction, the resolving power of a VIPA is determined by the reflectivity of the back surface of the VIPA and the thickness of the glass plate. For a fixed thickness, a high reflectivity causes light to stay longer in the VIPA. This creates more virtual sources of light and thus increases the resolving power. On the other hand, with a lower reflectivity, the light in the VIPA is quickly lost, meaning fewer virtual sources of light are superimposed. This results in lower resolving power.

Free-Form Shape Cold-Bent Structural Silicone Glazed Fa\u00e7ades - Design Concept and Challenges This is more obvious when we stack glass panes on top of each other; they transmit light but prevent visual connection. Similarly, cast glass produced in larger thicknesses can create more distortion compared to thinner float glass, due to the larger distance the light has to travel through the medium. Given the fact that a flat glass surface can transmit, absorb and reflect the light, the more the layers the greater the optical illusions (Brzezicki 2017). This phenomenon is evident in cavity geometries, such as hollow glass, where the double panes create more reflections and alter the perceived image, or alternatively, in the overall configuration of the structure. A monolithic cast glass wall would create less distortion than a wall of the same thickness comprising of fins and plates under certain angles of view; the more the overlapping elements, the greater the optical phenomena (Fig. 11).

The rod is glowing bright red; the glass is glowing a relatively dim orange. In fact, if we look carefully, we see that the part of the glass immediately next to the end of the rod actually looks dark; that part of the glass may be the coolest part, though it's certainly at least as hot as the rod end. The visible orange glow seems to be limited to the portion a finger's width away from the end of the rod, where we might expect the glass to be substantially hotter than the rod. So, what can we say? The glass is apparently transparent, or nearly so; it is glowing, but apparently quite a bit less strongly than the metal rod embedded in it. The second law predicts that transparent glass should glow less brightly than the opaque rod, and that to the extent that the glass glows, it must not be fully transparent. While these photos don't let us conclude anything quantitative about either the brightness or transparency of the glass, they seem to be consistent with what was predicted. Unfortunately we also can't tell from these pictures whether the glass has become any less transparent when heated to the point of glowing. This is an unsatisfactory conclusion, and I may add to this section if I can obtain some more quantitative results.

Necreaux Kain0_0Kain0_0 You need a secondary structure, a primary one, and transparent cladding Modern day skyscrapers are often clad in glass, to form full height glass 'walls'. This is achieved with what is called a 'curtain walling system'. It is essentially a primary structure, with a secondary structure attached that supports smaller glazed panels. This enables the following advantages: The wall is not supported by glass, but instead a protected robust structure behind it. The wall is partially flexible, wind loads could slightly bend the wall as the glass is segmented. The secondary structure under could cater for deflection, while the primary structure caters for the main static load. The glass could be as thick, strong or rigid as needed, just being accommodated with a thick structure as needed behind it. The structure behind can be a truss-like structure, using lightweight steel elements (much like high voltage towers), in particular if you do not require the wall to be habitable. The interior structure has the added advantage that it is protected from weather.

The thinness of the glass also increased its transparency with the thicker build up having an increased light absorption. The curvature results in an increase in light transmission of 20%.

It hardly lets any light in and is very good for stopping the suns radiation. Vision glass lets a lot more heat in, and a film or tint on the glass helps reduce heat gain. @ Aplenty- I would just like to point out the difference between spandrel glass and the glazed glass on a building. Spandrel glass is designed to hide the structure, so it is created to be only opaque enough to give the glass depth and dimension. The glazed glass that covers the windows is meant to be translucent.

Architects use spandrel glass to create the flowing glass curtains that wrap around some structures.

The entire hotel is covered in insulating glass coated with an optically thin 24K gold film.

In the beginning, manufacturers mixed the material in with the glass, so that it permeated the lenses. But the glass versions of photochromatic glasses were heavy and awkward, and as technology advanced, they were replaced with both plastic and polycarbonate materials. The silver halide substance was mixed in with these materials in the same way, but the glasses were much lighter and more flexible. Since the lens material darkened throughout with this permeation approach, how dark the lens become depended on how thick it was. Thin lenses did not provide as much shading protection, and thick lenses could become too dark for users.

The amount that is absorbed depends on the type of, additives to, and thickness of the glazing. The amount that is reflected depends on the nature of the surface and the angle of incidence of the radiation. Each of these factors will be explained below, starting with absorption. **Figure 9.18a** The total"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "of the glass."}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2023-06", "text": "in those occurrences, the glass panel has to remain perceptible.

The Importance of Light Just as for the \u201cspace haze\u201d, we relied on light to make our glass panel shine. First stop: the glare. Even if it serves as a display for our user interface, the glass panel is not a typical screen and, as light comes through, we could not produce a glare effect similar to the one you can experience with your own computer monitor. However, stars have an important place in our game and we ended up with a half-halo half-glare effect that helps grounding the glass panel and understanding the actual movement in space during interplanetary travels. The glare \u201cring\u201d can be seen during the travel phases as the screen-space position of the star changes This is basically a screen-space effect relative to the position of the current star. The further away from the screen-space position of the star (simulating a grazing light), the grayer the glass becomes. And as we only consider the center of the star, with its light radiating around it, the effect produces a round shape on the glass panel.

By themselves, they contain intricate works of art with vivid color palettes that overlay silhouettes of the outside world. They\u2019re like a dreamy, imaginative capture of the beauty of nature and of the precise capability of human to weave intricacy into the commonplace object. But what make stained glass an extremely unique medium is its shadow. The shadows stained glass windows cast serve a utilitarian architectural purpose (that of lighting insides of churches and other buildings) while being a deep expression of color and emotion (Figs. 1, 2). It is almost as if every stained-glass panel has the capability to tell a multifaceted story by itself. Figure 1: The north rose window of the Chartres Cathedral, France.

Part of the reflected light overlays image as scattered light distributed evenly over the whole frame area. The scattered light causes additional unwanted lighting of objects. If there is no scattered light, a lens would give an image with relative brightness of different areas matched with brightness of corresponding object areas. Brightness ranges of the object and its image could be same. But it is not so in real life. Light scattering in modern coated lenses is about 1-2%, sometimes 3% (non-coated lenses may have light scattering of 10-15%). But even this small value may affect image quality significantly in some cases. A scattered light overlay shadow parts of the image and makes them brighter that decreases overall image brightness range. Larger overall brightness range leads to higher effect of scattered light. Image contrast drops in bright and dark areas not evenly. Bright areas almost not affected. But in dark shadows scattered light produces noticeable effect. So, scattered light decreases overall image contrast and causes non-uniform rendering of brightness in shadows and at bright spots. On the color film, light scattering may cause unwanted toning of shadows with bright color of the object since such color will dominate in the scattered light spectrum.

These coatings don't block as much of the short-wave infrared light from the sun, but do block any long-wave infrared light coming from the inside, functioning as somewhat of a greenhouse. These coatings are placed on the inner pane of glass, on the outer face if less solar heat gain is desired, and on the inner face if more solar heat gain is desired.

One trade-off of low-e coatings is that while they are primarily aimed at reducing the amount of infrared light passing through the window, they do also somewhat reduce the amount of visible light passing through, and the building may incur higher lighting demand as a result.

History Wood's glass was developed as a light filter used in communications during World War I. The glass filter worked both in infrared daylight communication and ultraviolet night communications by removing the visible components of a light beam, leaving only the \"invisible radiation\" as a signal beam. Wood's glass was commonly used to form the envelope for fluorescent and incandescent ultraviolet bulbs (\"black lights\"). In recent years, due to its disadvantages, other filter materials have largely replaced it. Composition Wood's glass is special barium-sodium-silicate glass incorporating about 9% nickel oxide. It is a very deep violet-blue glass, opaque to all visible light rays except longest red and shortest violet. It is quite transparent in the violet/ultraviolet in a band between 320 and 400 nanometres with a peak at 365 nanometres, and a fairly broad range of infrared and the longest, least visible red wavelengths. Properties and uses Wood's glass has lower mechanical strength and higher thermal expansion than commonly used glasses, making it more vulnerable to thermal shocks and mechanical damage. The nickel and barium oxides are also chemically reactive, with tendency to slowly form a layer of hydroxides and carbonates in contact with atmospheric moisture and carbon dioxide. The susceptibility to thermal shock makes manufacture of hermetically sealed glass bulbs difficult and costly.

The light from the amber art-glass clerestory windows and skylights washes the interior, thus unifying the whole. Not only would shadowing affect the light through the art glass, but also if the shadows were to land on the exterior of the building, there would be a significant loss of the beauty and meaning created by the composition of planar masses. This play of light on surface and void is part of what makes the building come alive and what is so striking about it. Anything that affects these key attributes of the building would be a huge loss to the congregation and the world of architecture.

We can clearly see through transparent materials, because light passes through transparent materials in straight lines. We cannot see clearly through translucent materials. Translucent materials let some light pass through them by scattering light in all directions. We cannot see anything through opaque materials, because they do not let light pass through them, instead they block the light. When an object blocks light, it makes a shadow.

A shadow appears the side of the objects furthest from the light source. * An opaque material makes a dark shadow. * A translucent material makes a faint shadow. * A transparent material cannot make any shadow.

The same object may be transparent to some wavelengths, and opaque to others. Ordinary glass, for example, is transparent to the visible wavelengths, but does a pretty lousy job of transmitting ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Adding certain materials or coatings to the glass can make it even more selective, resulting in filters that only transmit certain colors. Light that we perceive as white often really has equal amounts of all colors (or wavelengths) in the visible range of the spectrum, as discussed in the previous chapter. In the rest of this chapter, for the most part, we will ignore effects that depend on wavelength and concentrate on more general behaviors of visible light. For example, you are probably familiar with the phenomenon of shadows. If you have a single small source of light in a room, any opaque object will cast a sharp shadow on a wall or floor, and that shadow will have the shape of the outline of the object. This tells us that on normal human length scales, light travels in straight lines. This somewhat trivial observation turns out to be an important tool for understanding all of the principles of basic optics. Let's be a little more careful here.

I have read about schlieren photography, which uses the ability of non-uniform air to create shadows. Is it really possible that air makes shadows? A: In addition to V.Joe's excellent answer about refraction, I want to add that air does directly block (absorb, not refract) some infrared and ultra-violet light. If your eyes could see light in the infrared and UV spectrums, air would appear partially opaque in those wavelengths. The surface of the earth is in the infrared and UV 'shadow' of the atmosphere. A: Taken from this site: Yes, air can indeed make shadows. A shadow occurs when an object in a light beam prevents some of the light from continuing on in the forward direction. When the light beam hits a wall or the ground, a darker shape is visible where less light is hitting the surface. Both the light and the shadow, which is just the absence of light, travel to the surface at the speed of light. There are three ways that an object can prevent light from continuing on in the forward direction: Absorption: The light that hits the object is absorbed and converted to heat. A black table creates a shadow on the wall mostly by absorbing the light that hits it.

There is a certain class of bodies which obstruct the passage of the rays of light, and where light is not, a shadow is cast, and the substance producing the shadow is said to be opaque. Wood, stone, the metals, charcoal, are all examples of opacity; whilst glass, talc, and horn allow a certain number of the rays to travel through their particles, and are therefore called transparent. Nature, however, never indulges in sudden extremes, and as no substance is so opaque as not (when reduced in thickness) to allow a certain amount of light to pass through its substance, so, on the other hand, however transparent a body may be, a greater or lesser number of the rays are always stopped, and hence opacity and transparency are regarded as two extremes of a long chain; being connected together by numerous intermediate links, they pass by insensible gradations the one into the other.

Answer: Shadow is not just the two-dimensional outline that you see on the ground. All the space behind the opaque object up to some distance behind it seems to be filled with the shadow Question 18. What do we need in order to see a shadow? Answer: We need the following in order to see a shadow a source of light, an opaque object in the way of light, and a screen; Question 19. Does the direction of shadow change during the day? Does the length of shadow also change from season to season? Answer: Yes, the direction of shadow changes as the sun changes its position during the day. The length of the shadow also changes from season to season. Question 20. Define screen. Answer: Screen is a surface on which images are formed. Question 21. What is umbra and penumbra? Answer: Umbra is the dark region behind the object facing light which does not receive light at all. Penumbra is the less dark part of a shadow. It is the outer part of a shadow. Question 22."}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "Light is the important part of our life.

This explanation explains why you can't see perfectly through a colored translucent object (because some of the light is being reflected rather than transmitted), and also why the shadow is the same color (because the same color is the one being transmitted.) Kosta Butbaia's answer is on the right track, but he missed the fact that quite of bit of the one color of light gets reflected as well as transmitted. His diagram suggests that if you and the light source were on the same side of the translucent object, it would appear completely black, which isn't the case for most colored transparent objects - they usually look more or less the same color on both sides, no matter where the light source is. \u2022 The key for me to understand this was: that they absorb all colors but one (just like a regular colored object), and that one color they partially transmit and partially reflect.

Opaque material is material dense enough to reflect most of the light back, there will invariably be some space where photons will squeeze through. Since it's such a small amount of photons our eyes can't detect them. With something like a cement wall, it's structure is so dense it becomes increasingly unlikely that a photon is able to get all the way through. With an opaque fabric photons will likely get through it just won't be noticeable. A: If you are restricting the photon to the visible spectrum, then no. However, if you refer to very low energy light such as radio, then it is possible for photons to pass through visibly opaque materials.

Figure 6.2a -- Glass in the oven at Corning So-called lead crystal glass is extremely transparent. I don't know the exact amount of light it absorbs, but even in thick sections, it's certainly very little -- nearly all the light passes through. Consequently, as we've just seen, it must radiate far less than an ideal blackbody, at least in the visible spectrum. However, when glass is heated very hot in an oven, it certainly does radiate, and does so quite visibly. This isn't something one sees every day, but at Corning, New York, one can watch Steuben glass animals being worked, and the glass is heated red-hot to orange-hot when it's being formed -- and it glows orange. My recollection from a trip to Corning about 25 years ago was that the glass was actually glowing very brightly. What could we conclude from this? To the extent that the glass is glowing, it must not be transparent. Though the glow of hot glass may be dimmer than the glow of equally hot opaque material (such as steel) I none the less recalled it as being quite bright -- far brighter than one would expect if it were radiating only a tiny fraction as much light as hot metal. If my memory was correct, we would be forced to conclude that, according to the second law, glass, when heated very hot, must turn opaque, or at least it must turn semi-transparent.

As this happens, the molecules gradually move more and more slowly, until they are hardly moving at all. This indecisiveness on the part of glass -- choose a state of matter already! -- has led to the mistaken assumption that glass is actually a fluid. There is an enduring urban legend that the glass windows in medieval cathedrals are thicker at the bottom because over hundreds of years, the glass has \"flowed\" downward and pooled at the bottom. There is a tiny bit of truth to the legend. At the molecular level, glass does \"flow\", it just does so very verrry sloooowly. Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide in Australia, has performed detailed calculations on old cathedral windows, and estimates that it would take at least 10 million years for the glass at the bottom to grow just 5% thicker. She emphasizes that this is a conservative estimate; it might take much longer. So there's frankly no way in hell that the irregularities in medieval cathedral windows are due to the flowing properties of glass. Instead, the observed anomalies are probably due to inherent flaws resulting from the manufacturing process. (For more detailed information on the molecular structure of glass, whether or not it can be said to truly \"flow,\" and some fascinating early history, see this excellent discussion.)

But there is a kernel of truth in this urban legend: Glasses are different than other solid materials.\" Shattering myths: For all practical purposes, glass is a solid. But physicists are still struggling to explain how, and when, a liquid transitions into a glassy material. To explore what makes glasses different, the Weeks lab uses mixtures of water and tiny plastic balls, each about the size of the nucleus of a cell. This model system acts like a glass when the particle concentration is increased. A major drawback to this model system is that actual glass molecules are not spherical, but irregularly shaped. \u201cWhen the hot molten liquid that forms a glass cools down, it\u2019s not just that the viscosity becomes enormous, growing by a factor of a billion, there is something different about how the molecules are moving,\u201d Weeks says. \u201cWe wanted to set up an experiment that would allow us to see that movement, but spheres move differently than irregular shapes.\u201d In 2011, however, the physics lab of David Pine, at New York University, developed a way to join clusters of these tiny plastic balls together to form tetrahedrons.

Okay, so how do they explain the bottom-heavy windows on ancient buildings? Simple. In the old days, glassmakers used a technique that all but guaranteed that each pane of glass would have a varying thickness (see below). If you were putting a fragile, heavy pane of glass into a window frame, would you place the thicker edge or the thinner edge at the bottom, where all the weight of the pane would be resting? Right, the thicker side. So rather than provide evidence of glass seepage, old windows merely prove that glassmakers (called glaziers) in the past weren\u2019t fools.

Many glass manufacturers can add laminates of flexible polymers between sheets of glass so that even if one layer does break the sheet stays intact. Bingham says the glass on the bridge was likely to have had such a coating and laminations, but it would also have been toughened. This has two benefits: it makes the glass stronger, and when it does break, it tends to form harmless chunks rather than sharp shards. Toughening essentially squashes the outer surfaces of the glass and stretches the interior. This can be done chemically, which involves dipping a sheet of glass in molten potassium nitrate, causing the sodium in the glass to migrate out into the molten material and the larger potassium atoms to migrate in. Or it can be done thermally, by rapidly cooling the surface of molten glass and allowing the inner section to cool more slowly.

Their evidence comes from the condition of very old glass panes, which may be thicker at the top or bottom, or cloudy, or have swirls. They theorize that these variations are the result of very slow movement of the not-quite-solid substance. But is this correct? In the process of changing from a liquid to a solid, a substance becomes more viscous, which means it becomes thicker. Think of the difference between pouring water and pouring maple syrup. As glass cools, it becomes much more viscous than other liquids, to the point where crystals cannot form. Nonetheless as it cools further, it becomes hard and inflexible like any other solid. So what about the evidence of those old window panes? Actually glass-making was less sophisticated centuries ago. It is much more likely that the cause of the misshapen glass was the glass-making process rather than a tendency for glass to keep moving once it is cooled.

If a castle nowadays has glass on the windows, it's either not a castle (a villa or a church) or the glasses are modern. Most medieval castles did not have windows has they became common only late in the game (XIV century). In any case, if you go to visit a castle today and you see a glass window it's quite likely that it's modern. \u2013 Sklivvz Jan 12 '12 at 19:56 @Sklivvz we may be talking past each other. :-) To us uncouth Americans, some of those giant residential villas are also castles.

Actually it is probably better to describe glass as an amorphous solid. Any variation in thickness comes strictly from manufacturing processes.

Bent architectural glass Architects and designers love to interrupt straightness, corners and curves with soft curves. In the applications of the building envelope, glass is generally bent through a thermal gravity process. A glass pane is laid over a bending form and in the bending oven heated up to 550 - 620\u2103. After having reached the softening point the pane descends (through gravity) slowly into the bending mould and adopts its shape. The following cooling down defines the shape of the glass. Slow cooling, free from residual stress, produces a glass which can be further processed, whereas fast cooling creates a partial or fully tempered glass which is not applicable for further processing.

In fact, from test tubes to sight glasses, glass plays a significant role in research and scientific advancement.

What Newton wanted to know: Isaac Newton was so fascinated yet perplexed by light, he spent years studying it. Otto Schott, Carl Zeiss, and Ernst Abbe (the grandfathers of SCHOTT) owe a lot to Newton\u2019s famous work Opticks, but the trio pushed the field forward by refining optical glass. Zeiss ran an optical and precision machining workshop, and his silent partner, Abbe, was a trained physicist working on the theoretical principles of optical imaging. But Zeiss needed a better quality glass for his microscopes and lenses, so he turned to Schott, an expert in glass melting and the chemistry of glass. Buoyed by Abbe\u2019s physics principles, Schott developed specialized glass for Zeiss\u2019s microscopes, and these glass lenses gave the world a better understanding of the refractive and dispersion properties of light.

I have read an article about glass (zerodur) with low thermal expansion coefficient. It is mentioned that large casts of such glass are covered with reflective layer of Aluminium and used as mirrors in space observatories. Low CTE is so important in this glass, because changes in size of it would distort the picture taken with the telescope. But what about said layer of aluminium? It is metal and it's CTE is much larger than the one of the glass. So how does it happen that the thin layer of aluminium doesn't distort the picture? Doesn't it expand/shrink? A: Let us take the example of the Hubble primary mirror. It has a diameter of 2.4 m and a mass of 828 kg. It is actually made in a sandwich structure - glass-honeycomb-glass - making it about 30 cm thick (for stiffness) but light. The mirror is coated with an aluminum coating of thickness t = 65 nm, with a 25 nm MgF2 protective coating on top. Coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminum is $2.2 \\cdot 10^{-5} \\mathrm{m/m\\cdot K}$ and the Young's modulus is 69 GPa. If you constrain the coating to be of constant size, then you increase the strain by $2.2 \\cdot 10^{-5}$ per \u00b0C, and for a square sheet of aluminum with sides $L$ and thickness $t$, the force this creates would be $$F = \\sigma E A = 2.2\\cdot 10^{-5} \\cdot 69 \\cdot 10^9 \\cdot 2.4 \\cdot 10^{-9} \\approx 0.4 N $$ A force of"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2019-30", "text": "produce their unique optical or structural properties.

Most glasses are made by heating and then quickly cooling a mixture of ingredients. In the case of flat glass, which makes up windows, that mixture may include sand (silicon dioxide), lime, and soda. Silicon provides the transparency, calcium provides the strength, and soda reduces the melting point. The swift cooling process doesn\u2019t allow for atoms to form a regular pattern, explains Steve Martin, a glass scientist at Iowa State University. That helps explain why glass is neither a crystalline solid nor a liquid, but rather an atomically disordered (or amorphous) solid. The atoms within want to reassume a crystal structure, but typically cannot because they are essentially frozen in place.

I wonder why Metals with different colors perhaps do not absorb different doses of temperatures? and as a consequence, when different metals of different colors are exposed to strong radiation it is not so differently warmed? A: Klein's point was that the heating of cars in sunlight is dominated by their glass windows. This is exactly the same mechanism as in a greenhouse. The glass allows visible light to pass through. The visible light is absorbed by the interior and heats it up, but the glass blocks infra-red light so the heat can't escape. The colour metal is painted will affect how much radiation it absorbs and therefore how fast it heats up.

All I know about it is that it was taken mid- century (1930\u2019s) in the city of Bristol. The scene was taken during an afternoon, evinced by the lengthening shadows, which partially reveal the surface of a cobbled street, an iron drain cover, coal hole, and paving stones. The buildings in the background look industrial, with their grilles and neatly pointed brickwork. In the centre, is a Victorian gas lamp, mounted on a wall. In the foreground, one can see the entrance to a passageway or tunnel, painted white. Here the shadow grows darker and high up on the right hand side is an aperture, a vent, or recess.

To Mr Satterthwaite, watching, he appeared by some curious effect of the stained glass above the door, to be dressed in every colour of the rainbow. Then, as he stepped forward, he showed himself to be a thin dark man dressed in motoring clothes.\" Later in the same story, the mask effect is described thus: \"Mr Quin acknowledged the introductions, and dropped into the chair that Evesham had hospitably pulled forward. As he sat, some effect of the firelight threw a bar of shadow across his face which gave almost the impression of a mask.\" In The Shadow on the Glass, the literary effect is repeated as follows: \"Mr Quin sat down.

The principal wall material unlike many of Waterhouse's contemporary designs is a dark mahogany/brown brick combined with beautiful red/brown plane tiles and gables which are heavily half-timbered and pargetted with rough cast. Interestingly, Waterhouse was to choose a similar brick when he built his own house \"The Gables\" in Neutral Bay - between 1920 and 1923. The tall chimneys have their own gabled roofs and are almost a trademark of a Waterhouse design from this period.

Live audiences, primarily consisting of elementary and middle school-aged students, learn about an understudied time, place, and art form. They come away from the experience with a heightened appreciation for the arts and greater esteem for the Spanish language and the diverse cultures across the globe that claim it as their native tongue. Professors looking for experiential learning opportunities for their students will discover that outreach through shadow puppets is an excellent way to connect their students to Spanish-speaking communities. This includes training students to become performers themselves. 8 In just a few hours, an inexperienced cast of would-be puppeteers can learn how to perform with shadow puppets. In May 2019, Dragoncillo visited Buena Vista University and briefly rehearsed Second Hands and the Ladies' Man with university students, preparing them to perform at elementary schools in Storm Lake, Iowa, and the surrounding areas. The contagious laughter, thoughtful questions, and generous praise from the audience created a unique and beneficial experience for the performers and audience members alike. Each performer had the opportunity to practice using a shadow puppet, impart dialogue, and teach about a critical period of Hispanic theater history. Each audience member was able to experience a shadowpuppet performance, ask pertinent questions, and learn about Golden Age Spain. Dragoncillo's bilingual approach to outreach ensures that students of all backgrounds recognize the rich cultural history and artistic inheritance of the Spanish language. By highlighting Spanish and Spanish speakers, the troupe aims to center the lives and experiences of students who may"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "\\section{Introduction} Categorification, as envisioned by Crane and Frenkel in \\cite{crane1994four}, can be thought of as the process of interpreting a set theoretic or algebraic structure as a `shadow' of a category theoretic analogue. A categorification can endow familiar mathematical objects with richer structure, and can shed light on the structure by providing new tools to study it which were unavailable in the original setting. Categorification can be thought of as something like a mathematician's version of Plato's allegory of the cave. In Plato's allegory, a group of prisoners are confined in a cave facing a blank wall their entire lives. Outside the cave, there is a fire which casts shadows on the cave wall as objects pass in front of it. The prisoners have no concept of what the objects are and are aware only of the motions of the shadows on the wall. Plato's idea of a philosopher is one who escapes the cave and learns the true nature of these objects. Inspired by the ideas of Crane and Frenkel, we now attempt to ``escape the cave\". Linear algebra has proven to be an indispensable tool, having influence throughout mathematics and science. Therefore, one might expect that categorifying concepts in linear algebra would be of comparable importance. For instance, Elias and Hogancamp categorify the concepts of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and diagonalization in \\cite{elias2017categorical}. Just as diagonalization has various uses in representation theory, categorical diagonalization has proven useful in categorical representation theory. In \\cite{elias2017categorical}, Elias and Hogancamp diagonalize the full twist Rouquier complex, and as an application"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "the alley, however they could just make out the frosted glass windows.

And he knew, then, that to think of leaving Bellatrix to the shadows of Death, would make him vulnerable once more. Even in the moment of making the decision, he might become unable to cast the Patronus Charm, for he would have given up the thought that had saved him before. It occurred to Harry that he could still take the Cloak from Bellatrix afterward, even if he couldn't cast the Patronus Charm; and then he had to wrench his thoughts away from that option, focus firmly on his decision not to do it, or he might have just fallen over where he stood.

For not only does it sum up the books attempt to depict the fall of Dublin, but it does so in a way that we see such through Joyces very eyes. For we see just how strongly Joyce felt, that had he remained in Dublin forever, it wouldve have fully consumed him into what can be described as a kind of black hole. A darkness representative of a depression that would have turned Joyce into a shade as he believed it did to many that remained. And when one says shade one means a shadow. However, the meaning of shadow, in this case, is twofold depending on how strong the readers link to Irish culture is. For example, to someone that has no relations whatsoever with Ireland and at its history, a shadow may simply be interpreted as a dark figure cast on the ground or some surface by a body intercepting light. On the other hand though, to someone like Joyce, that body intercepting the light was Dublin itself.

It sounds obvious to say, without light we can not see anything, but equally true is that the kinds of light influences how much we can or can\u2019t see. In the illustration below you will see that we have the light source entering from the left. This causes the light to create a highlight or point of bright intensity on our object. As the surface of the object turns away from the light, less light reaches this side and creates a shadow or areas of less intensity. Thus the less light that reach these areas the darker it get. You will see on the very edge of the object, on the shaded side, it starts to get slightly lighter again. This effect is called reflected or bounce light. This is caused by light bouncing or reflecting off the surface on which our object rests. If the surface were darker, it would cause less or no reflected light, depending on how dark it is. Because our object is solid, it will prevent the light from reaching the surface on which it rests. This causes the object to cast a shadow on the surface. I spoke about the kinds of light in the first paragraph. To simplify and explain the way light travel through air, let\u2019s think of it like a little ball for each ray of light.

Hence, then, we look to cast shadows as a main auxiliary to express completely the character of the various surfaces on which they fall ; bearing in mind, also, that these cast shadows have invariably sharp and well-defined edges, whether the object casting them be round or angular. Apart from the assistance which we derive from these cast shadows, we should have a very feeble idea of the nature of any surface\u2014often none at all. Any object in sunshine would be a sufficient proof of the universality and power of this law ; but I will suggest one. When we see a horse and cart in sunshine, we shall find that the shadows thrown on his body by the saddle, bridle, and various parts of the harness, shafts, &c., by no means explain what are the forms of the objects casting those shadows ; but they make us distinctly aware of the precise curvature of every part of the body on which they fall.

A simple shadow begins within the line which starts from the edge of the luminous body _a b_. A simple shadow is one where no light at all interferes with it. A compound shadow is one which is somewhat illuminated by one or more lights. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SHADOW THAT IS INSEPARABLE FROM A BODY AND A CAST SHADOW? An inseparable shadow is that which is never absent from the illuminated body. As, for instance a ball, which so long as it is in the light always has one side in shadow which never leaves it for any movement or change of position in the ball. A separate shadow may be and may not be produced by the body itself. Suppose the ball to be one braccia distant from a wall with a light on the opposite side of it; this light will throw upon the wall exactly as broad a shadow as is to be seen on the side of the ball that is turned towards the wall. That portion of the cast shadow will not be visible when the light is below the ball and the shadow is thrown up towards the sky and finding no obstruction on its way is lost.

In these cases, mix your easy gray with French Ultramarine blue and Burnt Sienna, emphasizing the blue. ### Two Exceptions to the Rule There are two exceptions to this rule. The first deals with transparency and translucency. In a transparent or translucent object, both the body shadow and the cast shadow are affected by the fact that light passes through the object rather than being blocked. There is no shadow side on an object when light passes through it; a translucent object, such as a flower petal, will actually be brighter on that side. Light passing through transparent color will also throw both color and light into the cast shadow. (See Still Life with Peaches.) The second exception has to do with the tendency of nearby colors to reflect into each other in very strong light. In the study of the blue mug below you will notice that some of the pink of the cloth is reflected into the mug. In the painting of the orange in the page following, the shiny orange is picking up a strong reflected light from the napkin underneath it and bouncing it back down into the cast shadow. Study the shadows of a blue mug on a pink cloth. Notice how the pink cloth reflects back into the mug. Notice how the intense orange reflects down into the cast shadow on the white cloth. ### An Addition to the Rule The sun imparts a hint of yellow to every sunlit color because our sun is yellow.

Drawing in shadow Name: Pilgrimage Chapel of Notre Dame at Ronchamp Location: France Date: 1954 Designer: Le Corbusier In 1933 the Japanese novelist Junichiro Tanizaki wrote an essay on aesthetics called In Praise of Shadows. Widely read, the essay describes the difference between the shadowy world of traditional Japanese interiors and the dazzling light of the modern age, arguing that darkness is a difficult subject for architecture and design and its benefits are often unfairly stigmatised. Shadow makes light visible and many architects and designers have used this to great effect in interiors where it is possible to control the amount of light and shadow. A beautiful example might be Le Corbusiers Pilgrimage Chapel at Ronchamp. Light passing through the coloured glass windowpanes pours colour on to the rough concrete wall openings. In drawings of the south wall from the exterior the windows are shown as dark holes in a white surface. In the drawing of the interior elevation of the south wall, the white surface of the openings is literally painted on to a dark outline elevation. The window openings themselves have been cut out of the paper and the location of the small coloured pieces of glass are marked with pencil on transparent tracing paper that is placed behind the window holes.

Every photo appears different depending on how light strikes the subject. Let's start with the basics on the direction of light and how it can affect a photo.(Reported by: Ryosuke Takahashi) Relationship between the light direction and the resultant shadow on the subject Control the light and shadow to match the image of the photo you want to take The shadow appearing on a subject is directly related to the direction of the light striking the subject. If the light strikes the subject directly from the front, no shadows will appear as they will be cast behind the subject. However, as the light is moved sidewaysa strong shadow will be cast in the direction opposite to the direction of the light. Shadows are necessary to impart a sense of solidity to the subject and its effects are used in actual photography as well. If you can understand the relationship between the direction of the light and the finishing, your photography skills will definitely improve. Semi-front light Semi-backlight Backlight compensation You will find that the shadow appears on the side opposite to the direction of the light.

That was the angle of the sun we used to cast shadows in architecture school. At that angle, the length of a object's shadow would be the same length as the object itself. The shadow would be at a forty-five degree angle on the adjacent surface (if the surface is flat and perpendicular to the object). If the surfaces receiving the shadow were on varying planes, then the shadow shifts and modulates defining its features. Light and shadow define how we see form and therefore how we see architecture. See an example below of how we cast shadows by hand did it by hand. Beaux Arts Shades and shadow I was among the very last generation of students who received formal training in the Beaux Arts technique of casting and rendering shades and shadows. Considered quaint and outdated, it was soon cast aside in favor of more relevant coursework. This illustration is from a 1896 translation by Julian Millard from a Beaux Arts text, \"Shades and Shadows\". See an on-line version here.

Note the lack of a shadow from the pushpin. 5. _Looking at paintings_. When one highlights paintings, glossy artwork, or art behind glass, the challenge is to prevent specular reflections of the light sources into the viewers' eyes. Many a fine print protected by glass has become invisible because of veiling reflections (Fig. 12.13g). The accent light must be placed in front of the offending zone so that people of various heights and at different locations will not see the specular reflection of the light source (Fig. 12.13h). However, if the light is too close to the wall above the painting, the top of the picture frame will cast a shadow and the texture of the painting will be overemphasized. In most cases, a 60\u00b0 aiming angle will be a good compromise (Fig. 12.13i). When the artwork is covered with glass, special antireflectivity glass, which makes the lighting much less critical, can be specified (Fig. 12.13j). **Figure 12.13g** It is impossible to appreciate this glass-covered work of art in a famous museum because of the reflected glare caused by a circular downlight (top center of picture) and because of the veiling reflections caused by bright surfaces behind the viewer. **Figure 12.13h** Accent lighting must be placed in front of the offending zone. **Figure 12.13i**"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2023-06", "text": "ceiling then most of the fill light would come from above, and the talent\u2019s face would be beautifully lit on the camera left side but obnoxiously top lit on the fill side.

The fourth component is the shadow that the object casts on another surface. Finally, there is the specular or incident highlight, a spot of reflected light within the lit region. A specular highlight is a cue for texture as well as shape and light source. As Steven spoke, I kept thinking about Hollis Frampton\u2019s Lemon (1969), a masterfully simple demonstration of many of these principles: slightly changing light reveals a prototypical shape (what other things have the outline of a lemon?) and a surface that is both shiny and bumpy. By varying the type of light (direct or indirect) and the angle and distance of the source, Steven showed how these five components can be manipulated to bring out expressive qualities of the object. The cube, for example, can gain sharper contours through sidelong lighting, and illuminating the background can bring out its volume. Likewise, an object\u2019s shadow area can be controlled through fill light\u2014though Steven warned about over-filling, which can work against the precision provided by the key light. Another example is the way in which shooting glass or metal with pinpoint sources yields a scatter of specular reflections. If those aren\u2019t wanted, as in some car commercials, the DP can use broad, diffuse illumination. This \u201cliquid light\u201d brings out contours through a softer gleam.

It is light that reflects into a shadow from surrounding lights. In the image on the facing page you can see that the shadow on the sphere is not solid, but gets lighter near the bottom edge. That is because light is bouncing off the tabletop and reflecting into the sphere. Reflected light may come from many sources\u2014another wall or ceiling, or perhaps (in an outdoor setting) the sky. These lights bounce into the shadow side of the object most strongly in places where the reflecting surface is either very close, as in the tabletop in our drawing, or very strong, as from a bright sky. The only time you will not see reflected light is if the object is completely surrounded with black. Add and label the light areas. Too many reflected lights can break up the shadow patterns that give strength to a design, so sometimes they should be ignored or downplayed. When the background is light, don't put the reflected light on your object right at the edge or you won't be able to see that edge. Instead, bring it slightly inside and darken the edge enough so that it shows up against the background.

Imagine illuminating an object from several directions all at once. The sources could be from windows or largely separated lamps. We call this diffused illumination. As easy as it sounds, front lighting is easily explained. For instance, imagine a source of light in front of an object. That is to say, the nearer surface receives more light than the rearer which is in shade. This illumination is front lighting. The light rays illuminate the rear side of an object as they move towards an observer. Thus, the frontal surface falls in shade and casts distinct shadows towards the observer. Imagine an object resting on a white table. The light from the table reflects back to the object, making the shadow side lighter. Similarly, if an object rests on a black or dark table, the middle tones become a dark reflection. This is widely used to formulate theories of light, shade and shadow casting.

General Discussion We performed three experiments. Experiment A showed that the light-from-above assumption was used in interpreting cast shadows, and that shading information influenced the interpretation of cast shadows. Experiment B showed that the lighting direction was judged depending both on the position of the cast shadow and on the direction of the lighter part of the disk. Experiment C showed that the disk surface was mainly perceived as a plane shape in the gray conditions, and as a convex shape in the gradation conditions, irrespective of the shadow position. In this article, we have referred to some assumptions in perceiving shape from shading, for example, the light-from-above or single-light-source assumption (e.g., Ramachandran, 1988aRamachandran, , 1988b. In addition, we have also referred to a preference, that is, the convexity preference (e.g., Hill & Bruce, 1994). Assumption and preference are similar here in the point that both make a bias in perceptual interpretation, apart from their concepts. Although the light-from-above assumption has been well established in previous studies, the assumption was totally overturned by the convexity preference in Experiment C. As a result, lighting direction information from shading was incidentally determined; that is, the light may come from the bright side of the shading. The lighting direction suggested by shading also affected cast shadow interpretation, as shown in the shaded disk conditions in Experiment A. We saw another effect of the light-from-above assumption in determining shape from shading in the right panel of"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Directional Bias in the Perception of Cast Shadows Previous studies have demonstrated that the perception of shading is based upon assumptions about lighting direction, for example, light from above. However, it is not clear whether these assumptions are used in the perception of cast shadows. Moreover, it is unclear whether a perceptual interaction exists between shading and cast shadows because until now they have been studied separately. In this study, we investigated through three experiments whether the light-from-above (or another direction) assumption is used in interpreting ambiguous cast shadows, and whether shading information influences the interpretation of cast shadows. Our results indicate the existence of the light-from-above assumption in interpreting cast shadows. Consistent shading information enhanced the interpretation, and judgments of lighting direction were also based on both cast shadow and shading information. However, the perceptual determination of shape from shading was relatively independent of the cast shadow interpretation or the lighting direction judgments of the scene. Introduction Humans receive spatial information from shading and shadows as depth cues. Shading is defined as ''the variation of reflected light on a surface patch which faces directly the light source' ' (p. 289;Mamassian, Knill, & Kersten, 1998). Conversely, shadows can be classified as either attached or cast. When a part of the object surface is darker because the object itself occludes the light, this is called an attached shadow. When a shadow is produced on a distant surface, this is called a cast shadow.

For studio photography purposes, the term \"gobo\" has come to refer to any device that casts a shadow, and various pieces of equipment that go in front of a light (such as a gobo arm or gobo head). In theatrical lighting, however, the term more specifically refers to a device placed in \"the gate\" or at the \"point of focus\" between the light source, called a lamp, and the lenses (or other optics). Derivation The Oxford Dictionary gives three definitions (and others concur): \"A dark plate or screen used to shield a lens from light; (in a theatre) a partial screen used in front of a spotlight to project a shape; shield used to mask a microphone from extraneous noise.\" Though the Oxford provides a possible \"1930s ... unknown origin, perhaps from go between\", the exact derivation of gobo is unclear. It may be an American slang abbreviation of \"go-between\", or \"go-before\" (just as New York's \"SoHo\" signifies the area \"South of Houston Street\"). The term can be traced back to the cinema studios of the 1930s. Some lighting professionals believe that it is an acronym for \"goes before optics\" or, less often, \"goes between optics\".

The method assumes moving shadows on a dominant smooth shaped background. The shadow causing light sources are assumed to be strong enough to cause visible temporal frame diierences by moving cast shadows. These diierences are detected and classiied into regions covered and regions uncovered by moving shadows. Entire moving cast shadows are detected and tracked by temporal integration of the covered background regions while subtracting the uncovered background regions. Results obtained with various test sequences show that those shadows are detected and tracked successfully that are also easily visible to a human observer. A moving cast shadow in a video sequence is generated by an object occluding a light source with respect to another object. It's generation depends on the scene geometry. This includes position and shape of the objects but also position and kind of light sources. The light sources, the objects and the generated cast shadows in a scene are linked by light rays. If knowledge on the objects is available, these light rays can be used to detect cast shadows in video images 7]]1].

Loomis emphasizes that the decision to treat a scene or subject which an artist is attempting to represent, begins with choosing one or the other of these 2 types. It is important to choose only one of these types, and to stick to it because the treatment of light in a drawing is what gives the art an impression of consistency. The absence of light could technically also be a 3rd category, but Loomis doesn\u2019t even mention it because the drawing would be pure black. Any small amount of a subject matter, regardless of shadow depth around it, is an effect of Indirect Light treatment. With the casting of light, comes the Cast Shadow. Cast shadows are the areas of a drawing where your subject matter interferes with the direction of light, and that interruption shows on another plane in the form of a shadow.

This is different than the type of shadow called Shading; ie. how lights and darks fall on an object, as discussed previously.

If the assumption of light from above is adopted, a cast shadow may be preferred below the object. The other purpose was to confirm the perceptual interaction between shading and cast shadows (Casati, 2014). As the perception of shading and cast shadows has often been studied separately, it is unclear whether one actually affects the other. In this study, we investigated whether shading affected the perception of ambiguous cast shadows from the viewpoint of matching direction. If shading has an influence on the perception of cast shadows, the directional preference of a cast shadow should be enhanced or degraded by adding matched or unmatched shading information, respectively. To test these hypotheses, we performed three experiments in a random order for each participant. The first one was the main experiment of the present article (Experiment A). The aims of this experiment were to examine the existence of a light-from-above (or fromanother-orientation) assumption in the perception of cast shadows and to investigate the effect of shading on the perceived correspondence between the disk and cast shadows, for example, whether they were mutually independent,"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "and Cast Shadow Learn how artists draw cast shadows from their imaginations.

Unfortunately, our lighting equations would become horribly complex if we had to do collision checks along the incident light ray to figure out if a light should influence a fragment or not\u2014so we have to do more hacks. The simplest hack for shadows is to assume that light comes only from one direction and goes from somewhere mostly above the object towards the ground. We project a ray from the character's feet in the direction of the light source (usually, straight down) and, wherever it hits, place a small dark (sometimes translucent) circle or oval oriented along the normal to the surface. For greater realism in case the shadow should be cast on a couple of different surfaces, we might project rays from multiple points and deploy several shadow bits. When combined with statically baked shadows, this can be fairly convincing. A more realistic way to achieve \"I'm on the ground now\" shadowing and more is screen space ambient occlusion, which I recommend looking up and reading about! We might discuss it in a couple of weeks. If we want to get more realistic shadows that take the object's shape into account, we need to do some more sophisticated tricks.

If the shadow ray intersects an object before reaching the light, that intersection will be shadowed by that particular light. Whitted ray tracing mainly solves the problem that there is no indirect light in the scene, but the performance is not very good, because all the indirect light generated only comes from perfect specular reflection or refraction. This material is not commonly seen in the real world; therefore, it is basically impossible to simulate most indirect light, and another reason is that it only emits one Reflected ray and one Refracted ray for each EyeRay intersection. This problem will be better solved in distributed ray tracing. 3.1 Types of Ray Tracing 3.1.1 Forward Ray Tracing Forward ray tracing follows photons from light sources to objects. While the forward ray can most accurately determine the color of each object, it is very inefficient. This is because many rays from the light source never pass through the image plane and enter the eye. Tracing every ray from the light source means that many rays will be wasted because they are never seen by the eye. 3.1.2 Backward Ray Tracing To make ray tracing more efficient, the backward ray tracing method was introduced. In a backward ray, an eye ray is created at the eye; it passes through the image plane and into the world. The first object the ray hits is the one visible from that point in the view plane. The downside of Backward Ray is that it assumes"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2019-30", "text": "would start again with each 'hit' contributing to the final pixel colour. If the surface was refractive, then another ray would be needed as it entered, again considering the material properties and potentially changing its direction. It is the directional change of the ray through the object that gives rise to the distortion effects we see when looking at things submerged through water or glass. Of course, materials like glass have reflective and refractive properties hence additional rays would need to be created to take this into account. There is also a need to determine whether the current position is being lit or in shadow. To determine the point of origin, these shadow rays are cast from that current hit point (the point of intersection) towards each light source in the scene. If it hits another entity, then the point of intersection is in shadow. This process is often referred to as direct lighting. It is this recurrent nature that affords greater realism albeit at the expense of significant computational cost. What does this mean for games? Ray tracing provides the basis for realistic simulation of light transport through a 3D scene. With traditional real-time rendering methods, it is difficult to generate realistic shadows and reflections without resorting to various techniques that approximate, at best. The beauty of ray tracing is that it mimics natural phenomena. The algorithm also allows pixel colour/ray computation to have a high degree of independence - thus lending itself well to running in parallel on suitable architectures, i.e. modern-day GPUs.

You'll notice in the animation that the glass becomes truly transparent at depth four. If you look at the above illustration you'll notice the cross section of the correctly modeled glass has 4 surfaces to pass through before exiting. Since the first intersection is handled by the camera ray (corresponds to the 1 on the illustration) you would need 4 more to pass through 2, 3, and 4 and still have depth to exit the glass. This is what makes the glass transparent where we can see the ground on the other side. Let's add some diffuse bounces now.

Below the diffuse depth is increased for each render by one and you can see quite a dramatic difference in the amount of light collected. You may also notice that this is an artificial way to limit caustics in your scene if they become time-consuming or distracting visually. It might be useful to clamp the number of bounces allowed in the scene. Typically scenes have scattered specular and diffuse objects. Rarely do they all line up where you need to see clearly through many objects.

When it comes to raytracing reflections, Universe's occlusion function is noteworthy. With occlusion, you can essentially set a \"one-bounce\" raytrace for calculating reflections. This greatly improves the speed of raytracing, and yields the look you need at a fraction of the typical render time. Another welcome aspect of raytracing is refraction. Refraction allows a transparent object to correctly distort the image seen through it-just as a clear drinking glass bends light passing through it. EI has always had strong lighting capabilities. Universe gives you many types of lights, from spot and radial to parallel (simulates a distant light source) and tube (much like a neon tube light). Master Lights have been added, so if you have 20 lights on a building, you can link them to the same master light and adjust all of them simultaneously. Further, you can set which aspects of the Master Light each specific light will inherit. For example, you can simultaneously adjust the intensity of a group of lights that have their own individual colors. Master Materials work in much the same fashion for textures. Lights can now cast raytraced shadows. You can set drop-off, and specify the edge softness and number of samples used to calculate the shadow.

However, global effects such as shadowing and translucency must also be reproduced. We first show how they can be included in our approach using multipass rendering and discuss both the necessary preprocessing and real-time components. We then address critical software architecture issues in making the development of our system tractable. The complex dependences between multipass effects, the indirect framebuffer, and progressive refinement made it important to develop an abstraction to facilitate the inclusion of new effects and manage dependences, as well as abstract key low-level aspects such as data-flow and bindings on the GPU. Fig. 11 summarizes the data-flow for our final real-time computation including shadow mapping, translucency, and indirect framebuffer effects. Figure 11: Data-flow dependencies in multipass rendering with progressive refinement. We abstract and manage dependencies using a computation graph automatically generated for the features of a specific scene during preprocessing. Shadow Mapping Shadow mapping illustrates how multipass effects from the final rendering pipeline can be included in our architecture. Shadow maps necessitate one extra pass per light and require auxiliary data from the preprocessor (scene geometry). For real-time preview, the shadow map pass communicates with the main pass through a texture and our graph interface (presented below) manages communication and dependences when parameters are edited.

Shadow mapping has proven to scale well, but it\u2019s not without it\u2019s problems. In this article we will discuss an approximation shadow mapping technique known as Exponential Shadow Mapping \u2013 and see the role it plays in modern shadow algorithms. Before we can discussing Exponential Shadow Maps, it\u2019s imperative that you understand traditional shadow mapping. The traditional shadow map is basically the scene rendered from the perspective of the light (as if we could see everything the light touches), and depth information is captured for later calculations. After we generate a shadow map, we then render the light volume from the point of view of the camera (how we did traditional lighting in my last post, Deferred Rendering Pipeline).

The physical attributes of the object\u2019s surface, like opacity and reflectivity, determine its colour and how it will interact with existing rays of light. Since these rays propagate from the viewport, you can change the viewing angle, and the shadows and lighting will interact naturally. This rendering process calculates the angles at which light rays bounce off different surfaces. It also determines the exact positions of shadows and whether another source of light would illuminate that area. In this case, ray-traced graphics produce smooth-edged shadows, particularly in scenes with multiple sources of light.

If you run a level in devmap mode (type /devmap mymapname) then type /r_lightmap 1 at the console, you will see the level's lightmap.

Ray tracing based approaches are subject to noise or banding, and most other accurate methods either scale poorly with scene geometry or place restrictions on geometry and/or light source size and shape. Beam tracing is one solution which has historically been considered too slow and complicated for most practical rendering applications. Beam tracing\\'s performance has been hindered by complex geometry intersection tests, and a lack of good acceleration structures with efficient algorithms to traverse them. We introduce fast new algorithms for beam tracing, specifically for beam--triangle intersection and beam--kd-tree traversal. The result is a beam tracer capable of calculating precise primary visibility and point light shadows in real-time. Moreover, beam tracing provides full area elements instead of point samples, which allows us to maintain coherence through to secondary effects and utilize the GPU for high quality antialiasing and shading with minimal extra cost. More importantly, our analysis shows that beam tracing is particularly well suited to soft shadows from area lights, and we generate essentially exact noise-free soft shadows for complex scenes in seconds rather than minutes or hours. @InProceedings{CG_0133, author = {Ryan Overbeck and Ravi Ramamoorthi and William R.

Quite how they manage to do all that plus their insane amount of post processing amazes me though. ##### Share on other sites Ok, but how do games like these perform normalMapping? The same way like HL2, or something else? Or would they use both, something like: - basic lightMapping / decal texture pass - normal / specular mapping pass for nearby light 1 - normal / specular mapping pass for nearby light 2 - normal / specular mapping pass for nearby light n ? I don't know if its a good idea to mix realtime lighting with pre-calculated lighting though... But the normalMapping effect is obviosly there. In HL2 you see much less of it, because its \"fake\". As far as I know you need to do realtime lighting for the normalMapping effect, since you need to know light positions/colors/ranges. http://www.sme.sk/cdata/1780250/bioshock_02_s_b.jpg Maybe its me, but I can't get these detailed shadows in a lightMap.

So let\u2019s start by thinking how we could check if a specific area (indeed a fragment) is in shadow or not. While drawing that area if we can cast rays to the light source and reach the light source without any collision then that pixel is in light. If not, the pixel is in shadow. The following picture shows the case for a point light: point PA can reach the source light, but points PB and PC can\u2019t so they are in shadow.

It's kind of complicated but all my scenes have 2 spot lights with shadows enabled and the shadow softness around 20-50%. But the trick is to select the walls/ceiling of the room in your scene and turn cast shadows: off. That way your spotlights don't actually have to be INSIDE the room, if that makes any sense? Yeah tried that, but then the light doesn't go through the wall, so what other setting have you changed? It doesn't? After setting cast shadows: Off, try looking THROUGH your lights. The object with shadows disabled should be invisible when viewing through your light source. It's still coming up as a solid wall unless I turn it off. Sounds like your walls might have two surfaces; one inner and one outer. If nothing else works, you can go to the surfaces tab, select a wall or ceiling and turn the opacity down to zero.

Is it because the flame is pure energy and doesn't have matter in it, or is it due to light passing through the flame and not getting reflected? If it is, why isn't the light getting reflected or retracted? A: Imagine that you have a titanium screen. It's thin, so it's difficult to see. You can use a torch to heat some areas to incandescence. These areas become easily visible. Now if we take a very bright light source and shine them at these lit areas, we won't see a shadow that gives us any information about the pattern of the light. Both the cool and hot areas interact with the bright light beam in the same way. The grid itself may be visible, but the pattern won't reflect anything about the relationship between the dark and light regions. The flame is the same thing. It contains matter (such as fuel or soot particles), but similar matter is also present outside the flame.

If your eyes and brain had a wide enough dynamic range then you could see both the flame and the things behind it. A: The flame has to have matter in it, because it is producing light itself.

Some scattering and absorption does happen in the flame and this should lead to decrease of intensity in the region shadow would be expected. If you can't see this decreased intensity, the simplest explanation is that it is too small a difference to be detected by your eye.

A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises. The index of refraction of air also changes as the pressure and composition changes, therefore these effects can also lead to air shadows. For instance, the pressure variations caused by a plane plowing through the air can cause shadows. Also, gases being vented into ambient air creates spatial variations in the air, and therefore shadow-causing variations in the index of refraction. The ability of non-uniform air to create shadows is used to great advantage in the imaging technique known as schlieren photography. In schlieren photography, the shadows are used to accurately map out the variations in the air. A: If air"}, {"title": "rpj-book", "text": "form or other of radiant energy.

If the object is the mountain here figured, and the light is at the point _a_, I say that from _b d_ and also from _c f_ there will be no light but from reflected rays.

Reverberation is caused by bodies of a bright nature with a flat and semi opaque surface which, when the light strikes upon them, throw it back again, like the rebound of a ball, to the former object. WHERE THERE CAN BE NO REFLECTED LIGHTS. All dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of light and shade. The lights are of two kinds, one called original, the other borrowed. Original light is that which is inherent in the flame of fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere.

Light travels in straight lines, and shadows are caused by an object blocking the rays of light, making them cut-outs on a surface with light. Imagine a black wall. If you shine a torch on the wall, it will make a circle of yellow light on the wall. However, if you put an object between the light source (the torch) and the receiving object (the wall), this will make the light shine on the object in-between, and since light travels in straight lines, it will block the rays that reach the object between from reaching the wall. This creates a black cut-out among the yellow light. Rays of light alone cannot normally be seen.

We used regular light from a halogen lamp to be able to see through most of the materials that we encounter today.

Clearly, for the highest displacement responsivity, and given a certain semiconductor technology (e.g. silicon PDs, with r = 0.6 A W \u22121 , say), the height h of, as well as the irradiance I 0 at, the PD should be maximized.

This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected after the photograph has been captured.[32] As explained by Michael Faraday in 1846, the \"light field\" is understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-d space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point. These additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel-point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm. ### Other image forming techniques Besides the camera, other methods of forming images with light are available. For instance, a photocopy or xerography machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static electrical charges rather than photographic film, hence the term electrophotography. Photograms are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera.

The first is the general background to electrons in vacuum and the technological developments that led to cathode-ray tubes as well as vacuum tubes that dominated early television and electronics; the second is how these led to the development of electron microscopes; the last is work on the nature of electron beams and the fundamentals of how electrons behave, a key component of quantum mechanics and the explanation of electron diffraction. Electrons in Vacuum Experiments involving electron beams occurred long before the discovery of the electron; indeed, the name \u0113lektron comes from the Greek word for amber, which in turn is connected to the recording of electrostatic charging by Thales of Miletus around 585 BCE, and possibly others even earlier. In 1650, Otto von Guericke invented the vacuum pump allowing for study of the effects of high voltage electricity passing through rarefied air. In 1838, Michael Faraday applied a high voltage between two metal electrodes at either end of a glass tube that had been partially evacuated of air, and noticed a strange light arc with its beginning at the cathode (negative electrode) and its end at the anode (positive electrode). Building on this In the 1850's, Heinrich Geissler was able to achieve a pressure of around 10\u22123 atmospheres, inventing what became known as Geissler tubes.

The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or fluoresce, usually yellow-green. Later experimenters painted the back wall of Crookes tubes with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible. This accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube, such as the anode, cast a sharp-edged shadow on the tube wall. Johann Hittorf was first to recognise in 1869 that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadow. In 1876, Eugen Goldstein proved that they came from the cathode, and named them cathode rays (Kathodenstrahlen). At the time, atoms were the smallest particles known and were believed to be indivisible, the electron was unknown, and what carried electric currents was a mystery. During the last quarter of the 19th century, many ingenious types of Crookes tubes were invented and used in historic experiments to determine what cathode rays were (see below). There were two theories: Crookes believed they were 'radiant matter'; that is, electrically charged atoms, while German scientists Hertz and Goldstein believed they were 'aether vibrations'; some new form of electromagnetic waves. The debate was resolved in 1897 when J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen.

The air in the tube was evacuated, and when a high voltage was applied, the tube produced a fluorescent glow. Roentgen shielded the tube with heavy black paper and discovered a green coloured fluorescent light generated by a material located a few feet away from the tube.

Let _c f_ be a broad light and _n_ be the object in front of it, casting a shadow on the plane, and let _a b_ be the plane. It is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the shadow _n_ on the plane, but that the light has within it a centre is shown by this experiment. The shadow falls on the plane as is shown at _m o t r_.

This diagram shows how light rays could theoretically be bent around a concealed object, making it seem as if an observer were looking straight through the object. \"The cloak would act like you've opened up a hole in space,\" Duke University's David Smith, one of Pendry's co-authors, explained in a news release. \"All light or other electromagnetic waves are swept around the area, guided by the metamaterial to emerge on the other side as if they had passed through an empty volume of space.\" Pendry told MSNBC.com that the cloak wouldn't reflect any light, and wouldn't cast a shadow either. \"It would be like Peter Pan had lost his shadow,\" he said, referring to the fictional character who had to have his shadow stitched back on. Dreams come true, with a few catches Theoretically at least, the metamaterial could work like the helmet of invisibility celebrated in Greek myth, or the cloaking device that hid Romulan and Klingon vessels in the \"Star Trek\" series, or the invisibility cloak that came in so handy for Harry Potter in J.K.

In 1869, Pl\u00fccker's student Johann Wilhelm Hittorf found that a solid body placed between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow on the tube, e,g, Figure 3. Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls. In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished them from the incandescent light. Eugen Goldstein dubbed them cathode rays. By the 1870s William Crookes and others were able to evacuate glass tubes below 10\u22126 atmospheres, and observed that the glow in the whole tube disappeared when the pressure was reduced but the glass behind the anode began to glow. Crookes was also able to show that the particles in the cathode rays were negatively charged and could be deflected by an electromagnetic field. In 1897, Joseph Thomson measured the mass of these cathode rays, proving they were made of particles. These particles, however, were 1800 times lighter than the lightest particle known at that time \u2013 a hydrogen atom. These were originally called corpuscle and later named the electron by George Johnstone Stoney.

But credit cards are not without their risks, here's what you should know about credit cards before making a transaction. Credit cards come with a large number of benefits. The most important of which is to actually build your credit. A good credit can help you obtain loans such as a mortgage plan on favorable rates and avoid utility deposits. There are two types of credit cards. Secured and unsecured. Secured cards are protected by a cash deposit and are equal to the maximum limit which can be withdrawn. This is collateral. Unsecured cards are not backed by any collateral and are more risky. If the card's annual percentage is about 20% then the interest rate is going to be 0.0548%. The periodic interest rate will be calculated by dividing the APR with 365 days. Multiply that your average daily balance and the number of days in the month which accrued all that interest.

What is Credit Card Addiction? Credit card addiction is when your convenience at swiping that magic piece of plastic spirals out of control. You think you can stop anytime, yet you somehow excuse your behavior to say \u201cI have to use it this time; I\u2019ll stop after this\u201d. As with any addiction, it can have devastating effects on an individual or a family because of the financial implications of spending too much with your credit card, as well as the subsequent money woes that can ruin marriages and careers. Although they are very easy to use, credit cards are not always the best way to pay for your purchases. An addiction doesn\u2019t become an addiction overnight. It likely begins as a convenient reason to do something, before going on to becoming a convenient excuse. Then, it becomes a habit before becoming a must-do compulsion. Here are some common phrases along the way. \u2018I have to get that new credit card, have you seen the promo on that? Are they familiar? Most of them are harmless on their own, and may even be justified as financially-savvy decisions!

This growing reliance on credit cards resulted in Americans closing out 2015 with more than $900 billion in credit card debt, according to a recent credit card study by CardHub. That means the average U.S. household is shouldering the highest amount of credit card debt \u2014 more than $8,000 per indebted household \u2014 since the Great Recession. It's a troubling (and disappointing) trend, especially when you consider just 18 months ago,many Americans reported either taking the scissors to their credit cards or making sure to pay off their balances in full each month. But more Americans seem to be practicing \"swipe now, worry later\" spending habits. \"Many consumers are focused on immediate gratification; it is very easy to pull out the plastic and make instant purchases,\" Laura Beal, a lecturer in finance, banking and real estate at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, told CardHub. In addition to factors like income and financial literacy, CardHub said where you live plays a significant role in how well you manage your credit card debt and how high that debt rises. Based on residents' average credit card balance and income, College Station, Texas, has the longest estimated payoff timeline at 387 months (more than 32 years), which is 47 times longer than the shortest payoff timeline, 10 months, for Cupertino, California. Americans added $21.3 billion in new credit card debt during the third quarter of 2015, which is 71 percent higher than the post-recession average.

Next, the machine and the card exchange information to confirm the card and the information it generates is authentic and not fraudulent. Once confirmed, you enter your PIN and complete your transaction. Why Is This More Secure? You need to understand how older credit cards worked to know why chip-and-PIN is considered \u201cmore secure\u201d than previous credit cards. In the past, the only security feature built into a credit card was the magnetic strip on the back. This strip contained information about your line of credit, and it\u2019s what a machine read when you swiped your card at a cash register or through an ATM. The information stored on the strip was tied to your account and is what determined whether or not your payment was accepted. Here\u2019s the thing: this technology is the same used in cassette tapes. But we\u2019re talking about our credit cards and financial information here. You can see why this just wasn\u2019t secure enough to prevent issues like fraud. Stealing data from credit cards with just the magnetic strip is easy for thieves to do. The information is static, it\u2019s not encrypted, and it\u2019s easy to read. People committing fraud could easily take the information -- either with a credit card skimmer or by taking the card out of sight and copying down the number and security code -- and use it to make purchases or even counterfeit copies of the card.

A charge card or a debit card may also be used to transact business with a bank through use of an automated teller machine (ATM). The magnetic stripe card is capable of storing data by modifying the magnetism of magnetic particles embedded in the stripe. The data stored on the magnetic stripe may be sensed or read by swiping the stripe past a read head. The analog waveform obtained by sensing the magnetic stripe must undergo a process known as decoding to obtain the digital information stored in the magnetic stripe of the card. Currently, there are hundreds of magnetic stripe readers/swipers on the market; all of them are at least as long as the credit card itself. These existing readers/swipers can be classified as either platform card readers or plunge card readers. Platform card readers are traditional card swipers with single rails, which allow a card to be held against the base of the reader by the user and moved across the read head of the reader. Plunge swipers guide a card by two sets of rails and a backstop. Once the user has inserted the card against the backstop, the card is read as it is removed from the plunge swipers. Plunge swipers are common on ATMs and other self-pay devices because they are less prone to hacking.

These cars are arranged with like poles abutting (north against north, south against south). At regular intervals where these poles collide, a magnetic flux or \u201ctick\u201d is produced. The arrangement of \u201ccars\u201d between these ticks (known to you engineers as Aiken Biphase encoding) is what carries the binary information that a POS terminal needs to identify and approve your card. \u201cIt\u2019s basically similar to an antenna,\u201d says Castner. \u201cThe mag stripe is putting off a very low frequency which the reader picks up.\u201d One more techie note: Because the coding is time dependent, there is a series of zeros (think empty cars) called \u201cclocking bits\u201d at the beginning and end of each mag stripe train that tells the reader the pace at which to read the swipe.

The answer may be Chase's national press release, which states, \"Research has shown that customers who use blink cards often spend more per transaction.\" In addition, the novelty of blink could lead consumers to apply for Chase credit cards so they can use the new technology. The end result is more money for the company supplying the cards.

Retailers in the United States mostly converted to chipped credit cards in October 2015 and slowly over the past 3 years we have all become accustomed to dipping credit cards at retail checkouts. So, why are we sometimes sliding cards the old-fashioned way rather than dipping (plugging the cards into the terminal) at some retailers? There are a couple issues behind whether a retailer has a chip-equipped terminal but still has you slide your card for payment. In addition to installing a new chip-ready terminal for checkout, the merchants must also install new software and then certify with their transaction processor that transactions are coming through accurately. Certification of their new process takes time and scheduling. Another reason for merchants\u2019 reluctance to adopt EMV is the additional time it takes to process a credit card transaction. While sliding a credit card takes only a few seconds, dipping the card into the card reader slot takes up to a minute longer because the transaction is verified in real-time. During non-rush months, an extra minute might be inconvenient but not noteworthy.

Isn't it time to look for a solution, before this happens? For instance, why do you have to give your credit card details to the retailer, to pass to the credit card company? Obviously, so they can know who you are, and that it's really your card. Okay, then, why not use an authentication system based on your ID, instead? Then, the credit card need only contain your user ID, which they could check, and tie in with the card details, which they already know. That way, the retailer would have nothing worth stealing. Of course, the authentication system would need to be fraudproof, and I believe there's a description of such a system at www.designsim.com.au/What_is_SteelPlatez.ppsx.

The more technical name for this technology is EMV (a shortened version of the card schemas: Europay, MasterCard, and Visa) but you can find usually find both phrases used in discussions about it. You may wonder what good it is and why it matters. If you are a company that accepts credit cards, this is a technology crucial to your future. The sooner you embrace it, the better. Chip and pin cards are more secure than traditional card swipe solutions. This is due to more built-in validation and verification. Without getting too technical, the big difference is that traditional cards use only a card number and expiration date in a transaction. The chip contains much more information that can be used to make it that much harder for hackers to fake a transaction. This increased security comes at a cost. However, the major financial institutions are putting pressure on merchants to accept these more secure cards anyway. These institutions often pay for fraudulent transactions.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images A security analysis firm called Gemini Advisory recently posted a report saying that credit card fraud is actually on the rise in the US. That's surprising, because the US is three years out from a big chip-based card rollout. Chip-based cards were supposed to limit card fraud in the US, which was out of control compared to similar fraud in countries that already used EMV (the name of the chip card standard). What happened after the US moved to chip-embedded payment cards? Chip cards work by creating a unique code for each transaction, and (ideally) require a customer to enter a PIN to verify that they want to make the purchase. This doesn't make it impossible to steal information from chip-based cards, but it does make it much harder to reuse a stolen card. By contrast, using a magnetic stripe to swipe a card simply offers all the relevant information to the merchant's card reader, which is much easier for a bad actor to steal.

That\u2019s actually caused by a positive reason: fraud rates in the US are low compared to other countries. There was less incentive for banks (and cardholders) here to make the switch to EMV cards. Understanding How the Technology Works Chip-and-PIN authentication keeps credit cards secure in two ways. The chip itself allows the card to communicate with the card reader when you insert your plastic into the machine. The information on the chip is dynamic, which means it changes. It also interacts with the card reader to actively create and encrypt the information it shares with the machine. The chip in your card creates a unique transaction code every time you swipe it. This code is only valid for that one transaction. Even if this information is stolen, it\u2019s pretty useless -- using it again would cause a payment to be declined.

The black stripe on the back is filled with data about your account, from the name of the card issuer to the limits on your card.

LD: In some places, merchants can still swipe your card instead of using the more secure chip method because the timeline credit card companies gave to merchants to twilight swiping the magnetic stripes hasn't come yet. You only get the increased security when the chip-based payment method is actually used, so your card having it isn't enough to keep you safe. GT: There's been a process called the \"liability shift\" - where the credit card companies are telling merchants with magnetic stripe readers, if someone uses a cloned card, you need to pay the cost of that, we're not going to pay it. It's been completed in most places, although gas stations in the US are still exempt. Which is probably why they tried using my cloned card at a gas station, but this particular gas station apparently had a chip card reader.

The magnetic stripe, sometimes called swipe card or magstripe, is read by swiping past a magnetic reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards, and transportation tickets. They may also contain an RFID tag, a transponder device and/or a microchip mostly used for business premises access control or electronic payment. Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented in Denmark around 1900 for recording audio. In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960, IBM used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards, under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions. Magnetic storage was known from World War II and computer data storage in the 1950s. In 1969 Forrest Parry, an IBM engineer, had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape, the predominant storage medium at the time, to a plastic card base."}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Q: What is the easiest way to get track data off a simple USB HID magnetic card reader?

A: Every card reader I've seen has had a keyboard emulator, so you swipe the card and it sends characters through the keyboard buffer. Looks like this one also does that (documentation : http://www.magtek.com/documentation/public/99875206-16.01.pdf) Page 14 describes the data sent after a swipe, which is again, fairly standard across card readers: [Tk1 SS] [Tk1 Data] [ES] [Tk2 SS] [Tk2 Data] [ES] [Tk3 SS] [Tk3 Data] [ES] [CR] So your track one data starts with % and ends with ? Track two data starts with ; and ends with ?

Though they seem small and light, plastic bags have a much larger environmental footprint than you may imagine, beginning with the energy required to make them. Twelve million barrels of oil are used to manufacture the plastic bags consumed in the United States each year, according to Waste Management Northwest. On a smaller scale, according to SPREP.org, you could drive a car a mile for the same amount of gasoline it takes to manufacture 14 plastic bags. The effects of plastic on the environment can be devastating. Plastic products such as plastic bags can take between 15 and 1,000 years to break down, and that\u2019s assuming they even make it into a landfill instead of winding up in water such as streams, rivers or the ocean \u2014 or floating around the neighborhood. Of the 100 billion plastic shopping bags Americans use each year, only about 1 percent are recycled, so a lot of plastic bag pollution is generated annually. Even where good intentions lead someone to recycle their plastic grocery bags, a lot of recycling equipment can\u2019t handle the task, according to a 2016 Business Insider article.

Another way to help this problem would be to have businesses sell reusable bags at every cash register and ask each customer if they would want to purchase a reusable bag. If people have easy access to reusable bags, plus an incentive like Target\u2019s to use reusable bags, people will likely use the reusable bag and be more environmentally friendly. Furthermore, by asking customers if they would like to purchase reusable bags, shoppers would be conscious of their plastic bag usage and therefore potentially feel guiltier about choosing plastic. People would then be making conscious efforts towards a cleaner environment. Eventually, after implementing more environmentally conscious actions, stores could begin charging customers for plastic bags. The price would not need to be expensive, but just high enough to encourage shoppers that it would be a better investment to use reusable bags. Even if you are normally very economically conscious and use reusable bags, there are always off days when you might forget your reusable bag when you go shopping. Off days happen and shoppers should have access to a plastic bag on those occasions.

Disposable plastic plates, cups, cutlery and anything else you could get your hands on revolutionized children's parties. No one ever mentioned that they didn't know how to dispose of it, or even that it wasn't actually disposable. Back then it was all about saving trees, so everyone used plastic instead. 1985 - The Society of Plastic Engineers' Regional Conference talked about \"New Materials and Profits In Grocery Sacks and Co-Extrusions,\" and pointed out that plastic bags were less expensive than paper bags. At the time, one thousand plastic bags cost $24, while the same number of paper bags could set retailers back $30. The Late 1980's and Early 1990's - People were still unsure about the choice between paper and plastic, that is, until they were told about the advantages of the 'reusable plastic bag'. The Film and Bag Federation, a trade group within the Society of Plastics Industry based in Washington, D.C., said the right choice between paper and plastic bags was clearly plastic. \"Compared to paper grocery bags, plastic grocery bags consume 40% less energy, generate 80% less solid waste, produce 70% fewer atmospheric emissions, and release up to 94% fewer waterborne wastes,\" according to the"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "to handle them for each customer.

What is typically less than three-to five minutes in line turned into ten. Now multiply that by every customer at every register every day. If, as a business, you plan to handle the same volume of customers with the same level of service, you will now need more cashiers and baggers to offset these mandated labor costs because of the plastic bag ban. And having observed this practice for a while now, there is no conceivable way for the average business I frequent to accept piles of folded up re-usable (see also un-recyclable) bags, unfold them, and fill them with the efficiency of plastic grocery bags.

The transport and storage are not just one way. The customer will take these bags home, and most will end in the trash or recycling bin. It costs 10-15 times as much to haul away the paper as plastic. Plus, for those bags that aren\u2019t recycled, the space on the garbage trucks isn\u2019t insignificant.

The polyethylene that makes plastic grocery bags is a polymer. When plastic bags are made, the polymers are all lined up side by side in the same direction.

Overflowing Landfills \u2013 In 2013, Americans generated more than 254 million tons of trash and recycling. By offering reusable bags to customers instead, you can help make a serious dent in that problem. Carbon Footprint \u2013 Making single-use bags require energy, and when we throw them away, we have to use the same amount of energy all over again to make more. Air Pollution \u2013 Making any type of bag produces pollution that floods our atmosphere, traps greenhouse gases and causes global warming. Make sure that the bags that do get created stick around for a long time! Deforestation \u2013 Logging accounts for 14 percent of deforestation, while fuel requirements account for an additional 5 percent. Creating, using and selling reusable bags in your shop will help lower both numbers. If that\u2019s not enough reasons to go green and take advantage of the benefits of reusable bags, we don\u2019t know what is!

But a combination of factors, including extensive government campaigns about the environmental impact of these bags that made me feel guilty and bag taxes that made me not want to pay for them, changed my habits. I assembled a favorite collection of reusable bags that were always kept in the car, ready for my next grocery run. Here in and around Hinsdale, the bags are thrust upon me at checkout, whether it's at a big chain supermarket or a smaller grocery. \"Paper or plastic\" is often the only choice I'll get. I'm never asked if I actually need the bag and have seen people handed a single piece of fruit in one. I bring my own bags because it's a habit and because I think it's important. Whether they're paper or plastic, disposable bags do cause environmental damage. This takes different forms, from the pollution caused by making paper bags to the remains of plastic bags that can linger in landfills or float in our waterways for literally 1,000 years.

Instead of going with standard white plastic bags, or even kraft paper bags, why not go with a frosted plastic bag to help your purchases stand out? Your customers get a unique bag that they can reuse when they get home, and you get a way to visually stand out from the crowd. Then, whenever the customer sees that bag again, they know where they got it from, and they think about returning for another purchase. The unique bag can do a lot when it comes to keeping your customers thinking about visiting you regularly. Instead of just printing on the outside of the bag, you can also color code wraps around your products inside the bag. Tissue paper often sticks out of the top of paper bags, adding to the color branding reach you can get. There are dozens of colors to choose from, allowing you to find the perfect hue to match your company\u2019s brand.

One such bill is LD 1532, sponsored by Rep. Holly Stover, which seeks to ban plastic bags in Maine and impose a fee on the use of paper bags. The measure is scheduled for a public hearing before the Environment and Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday, April 24 at 10 am. While the goals behind this bill are certainly laudable, LD 1532 would hurt consumers and do little to help the environment, and the language of the bill is so flawed it may not achieve its intended result. LD 1532 prohibits retailers from using plastic bags, imposes a five cent fee per recycled paper bag used, exempts people that use an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card from paying the fee and includes numerous carve-outs that exempt businesses from the plastic bag ban, undercutting the purpose of the bill.

That\u2019s because in 2018 American Express, in cooperation with Parley for the Oceans, announced plans to launch the first credit card made of upcycled marine plastic debris. When AmEx made the announcement back in June, the card was 12 months away from being available to the general public, according to a statement. \u201cThe inspiration for the card is to combat plastic pollution in the oceans and to raise awareness of this important issue,\u201d said AmEx. With bans on plastic bags, plastic straws in diverse parts of the world, and global campaigns that extoll the benefits of multi-use water bottles over single-use plastic ones, the appetite of the general public to find plastic alternatives if not cut certain uses of plastic out entirely goes without saying. But when consumers think of plastic pollution, bags, straws, food packaging and containers are typically the most egregious offenders. By comparison, little thought is often given to the plastic credit/debit card of which most people have multiples in their wallets and use daily.

SIM card holders have traditionally been the size of a credit card, often dwarfing the dimensions of the actual SIM. By reducing the size of the holder, Vodafone will reduce plastic waste by more than 340 tonnes and save up to 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted during the production and transportation for every tonne of plastic reduced. This amounts to a reduction of 5,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.

Landfills emit 2 billion tons of methane each year. Methane is 80 times stronger than carbon dioxide. Cutting methane from landfills is the quickest and easiest greenhouse gas to eliminate.

Companies like Visa determine these fees, which often involve a fixed and variable component. For example, the interchange fee might be $0.25 per transaction plus 2% of the purchase price. Generally, merchants prefer their customers use debit cards. That's because the interchange fees are usually lower than credit cards.

Besides, my experience is that many cashiers don't know how to make change. For example, if my total comes to $3.92, I usually give four $1 bills plus two pennies and expect the cashier to give me a dime back.

This is because paying for things in cash, is expensive and keeps poor people, poor. Banks around the world have to abide by global trends and help people to adapt to new environment. So they provide debit and credit cards to help you pay for things in shops or online. When you use a card to buy, say, food, the money is transferred from your bank account to the bank account of the shop. Exactly the same thing happens when you pay for things using your debit or credit card online. If these payments stopped working, then the entire economy would grind to a halt.

Between deliveries, bank transactions, and contracts large and small, scribbling your John Hancock is practically an everyday event. But have you ever wondered why you sometimes don\u2019t have to sign for a credit card purchase? The answer is a little more complex than you might expect. Before discussing when you need to sign for a credit card purchase and when you don\u2019t, let\u2019s review the reasons you sign for plastic transactions in the first place. The first is identity verification. One of the reasons you\u2019re required to sign the back of your credit card is so that merchants can check the signature on your card to the signature on your receipt. If they don\u2019t match, this is one way to catch a credit card thief. Of course, it\u2019s pretty rare that a store clerk will actually take this step, but it could theoretically happen. The second is to protect all parties involved (you, the merchant, and the credit card company) in the event that a purchase is disputed. For example, if you spot a transaction your credit card statement that you didn\u2019t make, the credit card company can demand a signed receipt from the merchant to prove you it was you who swiped the card. If he can\u2019t, your case is bolstered. But alternatively, if he can, he\u2019s protected from having to refund the cash.

They took it from you and gave it back. Today you need not hand your card to an attendant. They have shifted control to the user and allow you to swipe your own card.

It was these three qualities that, in the late 1950s and 1960s, led plastic cards to be mailed, unsolicited, to vast numbers of the US public, often without anything in the way of a credit check. So for example, in a period from around 1966 to 1970 \u2013 until the practice was eventually made illegal \u2013 around 100 million plastic credit cards were mailed, unsolicited, to potential users, in what the president of the Bank of America, Rudolph Peterson, called \u2018the great credit-card race\u2019[4]. These transactional devices had, therefore, partially morphed into marketing devices. The reason for this was that the very act of getting these seemingly insignificant objects into the hands of borrowers really mattered. An experiment conducted by a New York bank in the late 1960s showed that when credit application forms were mailed out, they received responses from only 221, or 0.7 per cent. But when cards were sent directly to 731 recipients, 19 per cent were actively using them within 60 to 90 days.[5] Like many other plastic objects, these unsolicited cards were clearly coded as disposable; they could be thrown away by the recipient.

But when you talk to, among others, Gerhard Klink of the Fraunhofer Institute\u2019s \u201cGroup Polytronic Technologies\u201d in Munich, he can show silicon bending. It is easy, really. You start with a standard wafer, build up your circuit on one side, and then remove the back side of the wafer mechanically until you achieve a thickness of less than 25 microns. (The technology for making wafers thinner has been well developed for MEMS sensors and related products.) At this thickness, it is possible to bend silicon easily. Why would you want to? Apparently, the makers of smart cards are looking at this. Many of you in the United States may not be aware that most credit cards in the rest of the world have an integrated chip, and, instead of swiping a magnetic strip through a reader, a transaction involves a conversation between a card reader, the card, and the card user.

A new paper from Tamas Briglevics and Oz Shy from the Boston Fed strongly suggests that offering a cash and, especially, a debit card discount may not even make financial sense for the merchants themselves. Let\u2019s see why. Consider a merchant selling to consumers who spend on average $30 for each transaction. Suppose that the merchant fee on credit card transactions is 2 percent (hence, 60?\u00f3 per average transaction). Suppose that the merchant fee on debit cards is a flat 25?\u00f3 per transaction. Note that the debit card fee does not vary with the value of the transaction. Footnote 10 explains why 25?\u00f3 is a realistic estimate of a debit card merchant fee. Conjecture 1. Because 60?\u00f3 > 25?\u00f3, profit is always enhanced when merchants steer the average customer to pay with debit cards instead of paying with credit cards. Suppose that the 1-percent debit card discount is a sufficient incentive to induce all customers who pay with credit cards to switch to paying with debit cards. Then, the merchant saves 60?\u00f3, which is the credit card merchant fee on a $30 transaction. On the other hand, each consumer who switches from paying with credit to paying with debit increases the merchant cost by 25?\u00f3 per transaction. In addition, the merchant loses 1 percent from the debit card price, which equals 0.01"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "size.

Consider the current case of Congressman Peter Welch and Vermont\u2019s credit unions, community banks and small retailers.

The research shows that 79 percent of consumers utilized paper money in the last week. In contrast, only 65 percent used a debit or credit card. This comes as a relief for vendors that specialize in small purchase items like coffee shops that have weathered the unintended consequences of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which capped debit swipe fees at 21 cents. Previously, merchants would pay a small percentage of the total cost in swipe fees where a $1 cup of coffee would incur a transaction fee of a few cents. But after the Durbin Amendment took effect, banks decided to charge the entire 21 cents for any transaction, including that $1 cup of coffee, which ate into profits. Since merchant are not allowed to pass swipe fees onto the consumer nor can they require minimum purchases, many have been biting the bullet on small purchases, though many still break the rules. Other ways merchant circumvent paying fees is by ditching card transactions all together and install an ATM in their place of business, which some customers take as an insult.

The ad depicts a football match taking place in a crowded stadium. As players attempt to score goals, images of credit cards and messages from the ad\u2019s narration appear. \u201cFree market competition \u2013 Main Street businesses do it every day and consumers are the winners,\u201d says a narrator in the ad. \u201cBut what happens when we let credit card companies play by different rules? Americans pay the highest swipe fees in the world, up to 3% or more, or nearly $1,000 $ a year in unfair hidden fees for families. That\u2019s why Main Street businesses and consumers support the Credit Card Competition Act. It takes free market competition to get fair fees. Visa is the Official Payments Technology Partner of FIFA and is actively promoting its participation in this year\u2019s World Cup in Doha, Qatar. \u201cVisa is spending millions of dollars promoting competition in football, even though it refuses to allow competition on swipe fees and how transactions are routed,\u201d said MPC executive committee member Doug Kantor. and general counsel for NACS, in a"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "credit card companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a good first start,\u201d he said.

Card processors, such as Visa and MasterCard, set swipe-fee rates, but merchants pay banks the fee each time a customer uses plastic. Swipe fees are typically 2 to 5 percent of the purchase price. Merchants have argued that they have limited power to negotiate the amount of the fees, which cost them and their customers about $30 billion a year, according to the National Retail Federation. They have also accused credit card companies of barring them from steering shoppers to cheaper forms of payment. Financial firms contend that they are charging retailers for providing a service that helps their businesses. The government stepped into the fray two years ago, when the Federal Reserve placed caps on swipe fees for debit cards but not credit cards. In July 2012, attorneys representing merchants nationwide reached a $7.2 billion settlement that has since tumbled to $5.7 billion as 8,000 merchants, including Amazon and Wal-Mart, bowed out of the deal. Those dissenters say the deal forces merchants that accept Visa or MasterCard to waive their right to sue the companies over swipe fees.

Better for Consumers? The issue underlying the dispute is the difference in \u201cswipe fees\u201d charged by the major credit card companies and banks. It is estimated that merchants (and consumers through higher prices) pay more than $50 billion annually in swipe-fees. Swipe fees vary by brand of credit and debit card and by the size and negotiating power of the merchant, but can be as high as 5% of the total. American Express charges higher swipe fees than Visa, MasterCard or Discover Card and small, local businesses, with limited negotiating leverage, are charged the highest rates. Merchants, especially small merchants, clearly would prefer that consumers pay with the method that charges the lowest swipe fee. If they were fully aware of the magnitude and the differences in those swipe fees, consumers probably would choose the lowest cost option as well because, in the end, it all comes back to them in terms of higher prices at check-out. But the Supreme Court sided with American Express by allowing it to continue to bar merchants from \u201csteering\u201d consumers toward credit (and debit) cards that charge lower swipe fees.

Credit card rewards result in a total transfer of $1,282 from the average cash payer to the average card payer per year. Benefits to merchants For merchants, card-based purchase amounts reduce resistance compared to paying cash, and the transaction is often more secure than other forms of payment, such as Checks, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, regardless of whether the consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, and can result in charges back to the merchant). Cards are even more secure than cash because they reduce theft opportunities by reducing the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank. Prior to credit cards, each merchant had to evaluate each customer's credit history before extending credit. That task is now performed by the banks which assume the credit risk. Extra turnover is generated by the fact that the customer can purchase goods and services immediately and is less inhibited by the amount of cash in pocket and the immediate state of the customer's bank balance.

Magnetic stripe cards, e.g., credit cards, debit cards, membership cards, and the like, have long been employed to facilitate commerce and for identification purposes. Generally speaking, a magnetic stripe card includes a plastic or metallic card base on which a magnetic stripe is affixed. The information necessary to conduct a transaction (such as a purchase of goods/services or an identification query) is embedded in the magnetic stripe on the card. Many cards also include visually perceptible or human-readable data embossed or printed directly on the card itself. The data embedded in the magnetic pattern and the visually perceptible data may be used alternatively or together by the cardholder to accomplish a transaction. In this document, credit cards will be employed as examples. However, the problems and solutions discussed herein are not limited to credit cards and may apply to all magnetic stripe cards irrespective of the purpose for which they are employed. Contemporary credit cards, which are representative of magnetic stripe cards, are widely employed to facilitate the purchase of goods and services by cardholders. To facilitate discussion, a description of a typical credit card transaction is provided. Suppose, for example, a cardholder wishes to purchase a book using his credit card.

Another advantage is the ability to assign specific types of payment to specific lines of credit. For example, charging emergency uses, such as healthcare expenses, to one of the magnetic stripes and personal uses to the other magnetic stripe. These are merely exemplary of advantages that the credit card, according to the present invention, provides to the credit card user. With respect to credit card banks, credit card banks which distribute transaction cards, such as the cards 20 and 40, have the advantage of garnering additional market share by replacing at least one other transaction card in the user's array to thereby become a card of choice. In addition, business/personal card synergies are achievable, benefitting both users and credit card banks. For example, a strong corporate card can add all of its business customers to its personal card portfolio by providing a combination business/personal card (and vice-versa). Such an advantage is even more compelling when card rebates, such as airline miles, are consolidated for both accounts on a card. Deployment of credit cards, such as the credit cards 20 and 40, is relatively easy to implement because the cards themselves are relatively inexpensive to produce since it is less expensive to manufacture single credit cards with dual stripes than to manufacture two separate one-stripe cards.

Well, it\u2019s not \u2018just a piece of plastic\u2019; it\u2019s a very powerful piece of plastic which can be regarded as a compressed form of cash. We can define credit cards as a credit system that allows the consumer to borrow money on the fly from a bank or a financial institution and use it to make payments to the merchants. In order to obtain a credit card, the consumer needs to fill-in an application form that is actually like an agreement between the credit card supplier and the credit card consumer. The credit card supplier approves the application form and provides the consumer with a small piece of plastic (i.e. the credit card). This plastic (or credit card) contains electronically encoded security information in the form of a magnetic strip (which is generally located at the back of the credit card). This information is used for authorising payments whenever the consumer uses the credit card. The consumer can use the credit card for shopping at merchant outlets or on the internet etc. Of course, this is subject to merchant\u2019s capability to accept credit card payments. Accepting the credit cards is, however, not enough. The merchant should be able to accept payments made through the credit card provided by that credit card organization (of which you hold the credit card) i.e. VISA, MasterCard etc. You can also use credit card to withdraw cash from ATMs (automatic cash machines) also"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2019-30", "text": "HomeGotchas / ConsumerStarbucks\u2019 plan to be your \u2018bank\u2019 comes into focus \u2014 under a $1.4 billion pile of cash (Wal-Mart, too) Starbucks\u2019 plan to be your \u2018bank\u2019 comes into focus \u2014 under a $1.4 billion pile of cash (Wal-Mart, too) April 14, 2016 Bob Sullivan Gotchas / Consumer 2 Starbucks and Wal-Mart are looking a lot more like banks lately.

Thus frontline employees can avoid disappointing customers, because even if a desired product is out of stock at a current location, they can find where it is available and perhaps help customers place an online order, which implies a sort of endless aisle experience. Many companies also consider headless commerce-a scenario in which the presentation layer (e.g., website) is decoupled from the ecommerce platform, even though customers still can easily click a \"Buy Now\" button or issue a verbal command to a voice-activation device such as Alexa to order a product. By decoupling the front-and back-ends though, advanced technology increases retailers' flexibility, such that they can focus on more relevant user experiences in the front end while prioritizing efficiency and consistency in the back end to enhance fulfillment speed. Moving on to the payment step, we note extensive shifts from cash-based toward card-based payments. Even among card-based payments, we have moved from swipes of credit cards to insertions of chip-embedded cards to taps with credit cards to touchless options.

Early credit cards were made of celluloid plastic, then metal and fiber, then paper, and are now mostly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic. However, the chip part of credit cards is made from metals. Cash advance A cash advance is a credit card transaction that withdraws cash rather than purchasing something. The process can take place either through an ATM or over the counter at a bank or other financial agency, up to a certain limit; for a credit card, this will be the credit limit (or some percentage of it). Cash advances often incur a fee of 3 to 5 percent of the amount being borrowed. When made on a credit card, the interest is often higher than other credit card transactions. The interest compounds daily starting from the day cash is borrowed. Some \"purchases\" made with a credit card of items that are viewed as cash are also considered to be cash advances in accordance with the credit card network's guidelines, thereby incurring the higher interest rate and the lack of the grace period.

Fraudulent transaction detection is a big issue in the credit card domain because the data set is highly imbalanced. The performance of traditional classification techniques has decreased due to this issue. Therefore, a dynamic fraud detection system is required to overcome this issue. This article proposes an efficient cost\u2010sensitive weak learner approach with a bagging and random forest classifier (CSWLB) to minimize misclassification problems and overcome the class imbalance issue. The proposed CSWLB approach is included in an adaptive algorithmic method (cost\u2010sensitive) with two weak learner ensembles (bagging\u2010random forest), which assigns high weight to the fraudulent transactions using the cost\u2010sensitive learning classifier and generates weight bags using a bagging ensemble classifier. Therefore, the random forest classifier has been implemented on the weight bags to improve classification accuracy. The proposed approach's effectiveness and efficiency have been computed on the Brazilian credit card data set. Its results have been compared with sampling, cost\u2010sensitive, and machine learning techniques. The proposed CSWLB approach obtained 765 total costs and 97.361% accuracy.

The card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance. There are two credit card groups: consumer credit cards and business credit cards. Most cards are plastic, but some are metal cards (stainless steel, gold, palladium, titanium), and a few gemstone-encrusted metal cards. A regular credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month or at the end of each statement cycle. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. A credit card differs from a charge card also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a charge card simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date. A credit card also differs from a debit card, which can be used like currency by the owner of the card.

After purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards, purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card. Prepaid credit cards are sometimes marketed to teenagers for shopping online without having their parents complete the transaction. Teenagers can only use funds that are available on the card which helps promote financial management to reduce the risk of debt problems later in life. Prepaid cards can be used globally. The prepaid card is convenient for payees in developing countries like Brazil, Russia, India, and China, where international wire transfers and bank checks are time-consuming, complicated and costly.

The idea of cashless economy is actually a revolution from the fiat money to digital money, generally adopted with the aim of removing the flow of black money and increasing transparency of the flow of cash. The move towards a cashless economy or electronic transactions might help to curb black money by reducing tax evasion and ensuring transparent functioning of the economy. Although, the risk of carrying money would fall, and a more planned structure of credit access and financial inclusion would come up. Government expenditure will increase in the direction of development process, as there is a possibility of increase in transparency and the flow of revenues. The past two months have witnessed a significant increase in the digitization of transactions in India and installations of swipe machines, be it at small shops or by street vendors. Achieving 100% cashless society will never be possible but one can always start from a less-cash society and then move towards cashless. Though Cash plays an important role in the society, and it is useful for discreting transactions, especially in the informal sector, it is very difficult to implement the concept of digital transaction.

By Ellis Hamburger Source Plastc Oct 7, 2014, 1:00 PM UTC | How much technology can you fit into a 0.8-millimeter-thick credit card? Last November, Coin offered a first taste of what was possible. The device promised to digitally hold eight credit or debit cards and let you choose between them at will. You could swipe Coin in any conventional card reader, and it would notify you if it had been lost or stolen using Bluetooth. Coin would have a two-year battery life, and a companion app that could hold your coupons and ID cards. But Coin still hasn\u2019t shipped. Today, we\u2019re getting a second take at the \"card tech\" category with Plastc, which manages to bundle twice as many features into the same svelte form factor. Like Coin, Plastc syncs with your phone using Bluetooth. It lets you swipe between 20 cards or barcodes using an E-ink touchscreen, and offers NFC (like the iPhone 6) for contactless transactions, an EMV \"chip\" for the latest card readers, and RFID so you can replace your office building\u2019s ID card. Even if you don\u2019t know all the acronyms by heart, Plastc already sounds impressive. But there\u2019s more.

Once you've confirmed your identity, you'll be able to add your \"old school\" cards to the smart card's app by swiping them through the card reader. Using Bluetooth, the app loads the information onto your smart credit card. How can one magnetic stripe act as many different cards? Like this: When you select the card you want to use, an induction coil embedded within the card sends a signal that re-programs the magnetic strip. They're just like any other credit card, so you should be able to use them everywhere. Most of the credit cards in your wallet are actually equipped with two magnetic stripes, called \"Track 1\" and \"Track 2.\" You can't see them. They are usually masked under what looks like a single stripe. Track 1 is primarily used for your name, while Track 2 is used for your credit card number. If a credit card contains both tracks, then your card will be accepted universally. But, if the card only contains one track (Track 2), then some credit card terminals might not be able to read it.

And it must prove to the payment chain - merchants and wireless phone networks - that it saves money or boosts profits. The wallet phone operates on contactless payment systems, which usually are based on a technology called near field communications. Usually in a contactless system, a special chip is embedded in a credit card. A reader at a cashier's station extracts information from the chip via radio waves. No card swipe is necessary.

Though Verifone has suffered declining sales in recent years, it still sold 4.2 million terminal units in 2013, according to a Nilson Report. The company says 75 percent of the units it sells are equipped with EMV readers. Part of the reason for declining sales, at least in the U.S., is due to the development of easily installed plastic swipe card readers \u2014 the item that launched Square. Since then PayPal, Amazon, and even Etsy have developed their own card readers to cash in on brick-and-mortar commerce from retailers who use their services online. And those businesses are expanding.

So, what does the data tell us? Is it just a matter of time before we are all using mobile wallets? Is mobile wallet technology really making our lives better and our payments more secure? Is it living up to the promise of killing off cash and plastic? The percentage of people trying mobile wallets has plateaued, and Apple Pay is in slight decline. The actual usage of mobile wallets is very low\u2014less than 4.5%\u2014and growth has flatlined. Security concerns were cited by about a quarter of those surveyed across all payment platforms. Nearly half of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their current payment methods. Most respondents rated Apple Pay the same as or worse than swiping a credit card for ease of use (69%), speed (64%), security (67%) and convenience (59%). The overwhelming message from the results is that mobile wallet solutions are not offering a compelling value proposition. In other words, they just aren\u2019t different enough from tapping or swiping a credit card.

The crowd-funded project, which consists of a plastic card with a screen capable of storing various payment card details and can be swiped at ATMs and payment terminals, is attempting to fix as many issues as possible before it makes the card publicly available. While it has been in testing for some time, Coin only works with 85 percent of credit card terminals, with the team needing more users to try out the card in order to improve the figure. The company is writing to the earliest 10,000 backers to see if anyone is willing to test the card, reports The Verge. If a backer accepts the beta, they will receive a Coin prototype months before the public can buy the card, though they will be exchanging their paid-for retail version to do so. Testers will receive a discount of 70 percent off the Coin's cost when it is released, as well as a 50 percent discount off Coin products bought over the next three years.

It's called Coin, a mobile app that comes with a device that looks and acts like a credit card but can hold and use information from multiple cards. The Coin device is a battery-operated card that looks much like a credit card and has a magnetic stripe on the back so that it can be used at stores. It stores up to eight cards at a time, and those types of cards can include credit, debit, loyalty cards, gift cards and membership cards. It does not include forms of identification, such as a driver's license. The company believes the battery will last for about two years, and when it dies, users will need to replace their Coin. To enable the Coin device, you must put the Coin mobile app on an iOS or Android phone. The app serves as a storage vehicle for all of the card information that gets loaded onto the Coin. You then add cards to the iOS or Android app by taking photographs of the front and back of the card and also swiping them through a dongle device that plugs into the phone.

The viability on plastic has been demonstrated,[3] and the viability on glass may occur for up to 5 days.[7] For these reasons, it is important to consider the use of disinfectants and to only touch eyeglasses with clean hands. As a precaution, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has also recommended patients who wear contact lenses to switch to glasses during this time.[9] The rationale is that this would decrease the frequency of contact lens wearers touching their eyes. Credit cards are frequently used, and thus, contacted regularly. In addition, they consist of plastic materials, and so can potentially harbor the coronavirus for 72 hours.[3] Thus, it may be important to consider disinfecting credit cards after use and engaging in proper handwashing.

Typical macroscopic swipe cards, like credit cards or hotel room cards, often encode the information magnetically. The specific swipe card model of odorant recognition we assess here uses a molecular vibration frequency as the additional information. The theory of Turin proposes that an electron transfer occurs if the odorant has the right vibrational frequency: discrimination and activation are achieved by an inelastic electron tunnelling (IET) mechanism, dependent on the ability of the odorant to absorb the correct amount of energy. IET describes a phenomenon well known in inorganic systems. The swipe card description was conceived as a generalisation of models like Turin's original idea of conventional IET within a biological context, but we emphasise that there are important differences. In our own work [20] we made a critical assessment of Turin's basic ideas, showed that the ideas seemed robust, needing values of key parameters in line with those from other biological studies. Our present paper extends the analysis, generalizing the simpler model of the previous paper, and assessing possible physical realizations. In our earlier publication, we could find no physics-based objections to Turin's model of the signal transduction mechanism in odorant recognition, in which discrimination and activation are achieved by IET. An advantage of such models is that they are potentially predictive. IET in inorganic systems is usually observed in circumstances that allow transmission over a continuum of energies.

Unauthorized charges may not show on a credit card account for several months but can unexpectedly appear in amounts of $5,000 or more.

You should watch retailers closely and any \u201cunder the table\u201d transactions should be reported to the local police.

For example, the A letter bag might have pictures of an ant, a plastic apple, a drawing of an arm, etc. while the B letter bag might have a ball, a picture of a boy, a small boat, etc. After mastering single-letter bags, children followed the same process with bags for letter blends, such as -bl\u2016 or -wr.\u2016 After completing the letter blend bags, children in the literacy group interacted with end sound flash cards, where there is one end sound, such as -ing,\u2016 and multiple possible beginning sound options to create a word using that end sound. After children mastered basic phonological understandings through the letter bags, letter blend bags, and flash cards, they worked with short children's poems.

Yet reports of skimming extend far beyond those areas. The Agriculture Department said it does not keep a state-by-state list of claims related to skimming, but in Massachusetts alone, more than $1.6 million in SNAP benefits was stolen from over 5,000 households from June to November, according to the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance. \u201cFor many SNAP beneficiaries, I think the message that they come away with is that they are second-class consumers.\u201d Betsy Gwin, senior attorney at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute Betsy Gwin, senior attorney at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, said it doesn\u2019t make sense that the lowest-income consumers don\u2019t have the same rights as credit, debit and other prepaid card holders.

How skimming happens Skimming is not unique to EBT cards, but security measures such as contactless payments and embedded microchips have combated it in the credit card industry. No SNAP state agency uses cards with chips, according to the Agriculture Department. Security experts say skimming usually occurs without the victim or store owners knowing. Typically, skimmers place devices on card-swiping machines by cash registers. The devices are often plastic keypad overlays that look nearly identical to the card reader terminals themselves.

From Table 3, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with Transfer-Transfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table 4, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the informa- tion, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \"why would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \"what is your name?\" while MISSA was able to generate the response \"why can't you use my address?\", which is consistent to the context. We suspect the improved performance of MISSA comes from our proposed annotation scheme: the semantic slot information enables MISSA to keep track of the current entities, and the intent information helps MISSA to maintain coherency and prolong conversations. Results and Analysis Compared to the hybrid model baseline, MISSA performs better on off-task content. As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table 4, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not.

Research has shown that people are willing to spend significantly more when paying with a credit card than with cash\u2014over twice as much in some studies. When we take bills out of the wallet and hand them over, our senses register that we now have less money. But when the cashier swipes a piece of plastic and gives it back to us, it feels as if we aren't paying anything at all. Even the order in which we encounter options can affect their availability. We tend to better remember the first and last options in a group, so rather than focusing on the merits of each alternative, we may be influenced primarily by the position in which each appeared.

Days later, Miles is bitten by the spider during a visit to Aaron's apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter has, but does not tell his parents, due to his father's distrust of superheroes, confiding only in his best friend Ganke Lee. Miles, who wants a normal life, is unhappy about having these abilities and resistant to the idea of risking his life to engage in superheroics, a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker. However, after witnessing Spider-Man's death at the Green Goblin's hands, the guilt-ridden Miles realizes he could have helped. After Ganke suggests he assume the Spider-Man mantle, and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did, Miles is inspired to try costumed crimefighting.

Consider yourself busted Barry Wood Earlier this month, the Rockford Register Star ran a story assessing certain National Football League players\u2019 chances for success this coming season.

I think someone substituted the wrong word because \u201cbust\u201d has a tarred reputation \u2014 particularly as a verb.

It was released on 20 September 2011 off their EP For King & Country: The EP and was the first single off their debut album Crave. The song reached No. 3 on the Christian Songs chart. Composition The duo described the song as \"really a universal cry of humanity for something greater than ourselves...[People think they've] got it all sorted out, and life will deal you those blows. This song is that cry saying, 'God, Father, hold onto me, don't let me lose my way.'\" They said the song was inspired by Matthew 11:29-30, which says, \"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.\" Luke Smallbone said, \"When we were writing this song, that Matthew 11 passage came to mind. When we go through life it's so hectic and get beaten down and we go through so many trials. The truth is that we have a Father who is waiting to hold onto us. He's someone we can rest in and He gives us that perfect peace. That's what I love about the song, the verses are talking about real life. The chorus is just crying out to God.

The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a \"thing of evil\" and a \"prophet\". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical \"Nevermore\", he is enraged, and, calling the bird a liar, commands it to return to the \"Plutonian shore\"\u2014but it does not move. At the time of the poem's narration, the raven \"still is sitting\" on the bust of Pallas. The raven casts a shadow on the chamber floor and the despondent narrator laments that out of this shadow his soul shall be \"lifted 'nevermore. Analysis Poe wrote the poem as a narrative, without intentional allegory or didacticism. The main theme of the poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word \"Nevermore\" is the raven's \"only stock and store\", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss.

What's going on? `slice()` returns a copy of an array. This is awesome! But there's this weird line in the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) docs that says slice 'returns a shallow copy'. The [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/tkcsy6fe(v=vs.94).aspx) and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_array.asp) docs don't mention this at all, so what in the world does this mean? Let's think back for a moment to [how variables work](http://prestonparry.com/articles/VariableNamesAsLinks/). They're basically just links to some other place on the hard drive where the actual data is stored. ##What hapens if there are variables in my array? What slice does is copy over the variable, not the data that variable points to. Say you make a change to the object a variable is pointing to. The 'copied' array will still include a variable pointing to that same object, which has now been changed. **Slice copies over variables as pointers, and does not create a copy of the data each variable points to.** ##How to create a 'deep' copy Creating a 'deep' copy means your new copy will have no linkages to the original object. The easiest to create a deep copy by far is to use JSON. {% highlight css linenos=table %} var mySuperNestedArr = [myFavoriteSuperHeroesArr,myFavoriteCatGifsObj,taySwiftsEntireCatalogueObj]; var completelySeparateCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mySuperNestedArr)); {% endhighlight %} When you JSON.stringify a variable, it creates a whole new object.

In this case, you would use 5.0/2.0 in order to get 2.5 as the result. Otherwise, if you just use the integers 5 and 2, the result of this integer division is 2. It may be most helpful to think of this as rounding down to the nearest whole number - and that is certainly true - but it's important to understand the implications here. Integer division is saying that 2 fits into 5 2 times only. This is useful when you think about things that cannot be divided. ## Hours in a year: ```"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "44, 2019: 44 min 11), thus encouraging Anna to question her recollection of the event.

The notion of accepting medical recommendations out of fear introduces the issue of power. Describing a patient-provider interaction as charged with fear acknowledges the provider's power to shape how a patient feels. A different patient expanded on this dynamic: If you look at someone who is the health worker and is putting on that uniform it adds some grain of believability unlike someone that is from the community where we live. We believe that the health worker will answer most of our problems \u2026 The other reason why a health worker is more believable than someone from the community is because the health worker had to go to school to do what he or she does unlike member of the community whose education will always be questionable \u2026 The moment the patient sees the health worker, psychologically he or she feels they have been helped (Male, age 48). The importance of medical credibility and power became more pronounced when interviewers asked how a patient might react when receiving a depression diagnosis. Given depression services would be new to NCD clinics, and moderate depression was not viewed as a medical condition, the ability to transfer medical knowledge to the patient becomes critical.

As a parent you have to deal with all the guilt and the care of the child, whatever that may involve and you don't know\u2026. And most people can't fully take on board what that means anyway. Like I said previously, no matter what you can say to people, until you physically experience it, you've got no sense of proportion or what it actually means in reality. You know, I have been asked questions by various people about what haemophilia is really like, you know, but we're all different, that's the problem, and how I react and manage my haemophilia is completely different to how someone else may do.

He was very careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and to leave them open to interpretation. He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: \"One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him\u2014I believe it was The Waste Land\u2014what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said.' If I could have said it any differently, I would have\". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can be appreciated both by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual, because their \"emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects\".

Some patients felt documenting wishes was essential to provide clarity, especially given the unpredictability of health. As one patient noted, \"you never know what the world brings, it's good to have something like this on paper\" (Patient 40,202). Patients were fearful of physical and cognitive impairment. Documenting their wishes was seen as a way of safeguarding against unwanted medical procedures and ensuring their preferences would be respected by health professionals and family alike. One patient stated, \"my daughter-in-law kept saying, 'You've got to get it down in writing before they'll do anything about it'\" (Patient 30,207).

In the epic poem The Odyssey, Odysseus and his men have to travel through the Straits of Messina, an area of the sea guarded by two fearsome monsters: Scylla, a monster with six mouths and 12 feet, and Charybdis, either a sea monster who produced a whirlpool or simply a whirlpool itself. Opting for either one was sure to result in death, for at least some of the crew, so the phrase \u201cbetween Scylla and Charybdis\u201d came to mean having to choose the lesser of two evils. 4 Bust One\u2019s Chops Today\u2019s meaning: Call one\u2019s bluff; criticize someone In the 1800s, when sideburns (and Ambrose Burnside) were at the height of their popularity, this phrase was often used as a challenge to someone\u2019s integrity. The phrase fell out of popular usage around the start of World War I, as men needed to shave the sides of their faces in order to accommodate protective gas masks. As a phrase, it was not only to be taken figuratively, \u201cbust one\u2019s chop\u201d was also to be taken literally. A \u201cbust to one\u2019s chops\u201d could reference a punch to the side of one\u2019s face. Thanks to the popularity of sideburns between the 1950s and the 1970s, and men like Lemmy, the phrase made a brief comeback before fading into relative obscurity today. 3 Give The Cold Shoulder Today\u2019s meaning: To disregard someone Although its true origins are unclear, the earliest written evidence of this phrase comes from the writings of Walter Scott, a Scottish poet and novelist"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2019-30", "text": "mud to cool off!

Give the Cold Shoulder Giving the cold shoulder generally means to ignore someone or brush them off. However, like many of the above examples, it\u2019s more literal than that. Its meaning goes back centuries (appearing in Sir Walter Scott\u2019s \u201cThe Antiquary\u201d in 1816) and refers to what you give house guests you don\u2019t really like.

I mentioned the term to my 91 year-old father. Yes, it was once widely used; and yes, it meant in no time at all. I have vague memories as a very young kind of waving around a wilted flower stem, or perhaps a stick of rhubarb, and pretending I was doing a couple of shakes of a dead lamb's dangly bit. Though I recall finding the phrase distinctly macabre Looking at the web, it seems there are all sorts of variations, two or three shakes, and with the lamb not necessarily deceased. And from this comes the much more widely used 'two shakes' - as in \"I'll be with you in two shakes\". Where did it come from? Well, the online dictionaries variously suggest an American or Antipodean origin - though one points to an earlier Yorkshire (that's where I grew up) or Welsh origin.

If you took the first example literally, you\u2019d think it was describing a person standing in a bathtub full of hot water, perhaps.

This may be because someone who does not have an intention to offend will resort to a lower amount of syllables, hence rendering the expression less coarse and ill-sounding. Therefore, expressions such as venga ya, no seas ___ (\"come on, don't be silly\") would use capullo more frequently than gilipollas. Buey/Huey/G\u00fcey/Wey/We/Way Buey/Huey/G\u00fcey/Wey/We is a common term in Mexico, coming from the word buey that literally means \"ox\" or \"steer.\" It means \"stupid\" or a \"cheated husband/boyfriend/cuckold.\" It can be used as a less offensive substitute for cabr\u00f3n when used among close friends.

Also in Argentina, since pendejo literally means \"pubic hair\", it usually refers to someone of little to no social value. In Peru, however, it does not necessarily have a negative connotation and can just refer to someone who is clever and street-smart. In the Philippines, it is usually used to refer to a man whose wife or partner is cheating on him (i.e. a cuckold). In North Sulawesi, Indonesia, pendo (a derivative of pendejo) is used as profanity but with the majority of the population not knowing its meaning. The word was adopted during the colonial era when Spanish and Portuguese merchants sailed to this northern tip of Indonesia for spices. In the American film Idiocracy, Joe Bauers's idiot lawyer is named Frito Pendejo. Burciaga says that the Yiddish word putz \"means the same thing\" as pendejo. Cabr\u00f3n Cabr\u00f3n (lit.: \"big goat\" or \"stubborn goat\"), in the primitive sense of the word, is an adult male goat (cabra for an adult female goat) and is not offensive in Spain. It is also used as an insult, based on an old usage similar to that of pendejo, namely, to imply that the subject is stubborn or in denial about being cheated on, hence the man has \"horns\" like a goat (extremely insulting). The word is offensive in Mexico, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, as it means \"asshole\" and other insults in English.

After managing to pass one jug off to a neighbouring table, we were still left with the problem of three jugs to get through. The solution? Drinking games, of course.

Kev had taught it to our group a few nights prior and it\u2019s supposed to be an old game Japanese kamikaze pilots used to play to psyche themselves up before flying off. Given the strong anti-Japanese sentiment that still exists among many Chinese after what happened in the last World War, we conveniently omitted this fact when Jack asked us where the game came from. The rules are simple. There are three words which are yelled out: Ar, Saw and Chor. Each word is associated with a hand action. Ar is said with the right hand being brought down once in a karate chopping motion. Saw is the same, but with the left hand. Chor is said with both hands being brought down. Whenever you make the chopping action, you point to another person, and their job is to continue the sequence. So the first person says, \u201cAr!\u201d and points to another person with their right hand, who then has to shout out, \u201cSaw!\u201d and point to another person with their left hand, and so on.

And my dad was a cop, so that made it even more embarrassing. Later in life, I took up martial arts and even trained with my good friend Bruce Lee. That's why you can trust me when I say that fighting is almost always a mistake. There's a Chinese proverb that says, \"The man who throws the first punch has lost the argument.\" That means that when an argument turns into a fight, it's because the one starting the fight realizes he isn't smart enough to win verbally, so he resorts to violence. It's always the dumbest guy who resorts to violence. What do you do if someone threatens you with violence? You walk away, even run away if necessary. Even if you're pretty sure you could take him. Bad things can happen in a fight, even if no one means them to. Someone can take an unexpected fall and crack his head open. Teeth can be knocked out. Facial bones can be cracked. And all the crying later about how \"it was an accident!\" won't change that. So, if you're threatened, leave and tell your parents. Some people are of the belief that you should just go right after the bully, fighting him to show you're not afraid. While this works well in movies, it doesn't work as well in real life.

In contrast to Klara, Heist does not believe that war is justified even to defend one's land, saying that \"Dirt is dirt.\" After the family spends one week at his home, Prince Robot IV arrives there to look for the family. When Prince Robot IV sees the manuscript to Heist's next (and last) novel, The Opposite of War, he surmises that it is an allusion to peace, but Heist contends that peace is not the opposite of war, but merely \"a lull in the action\". Pressed by Robot, Heist asks him about what Robot saw in his visions during the near-death experiences he himself had during battle, which Heist correctly guesses were explicitly sexual. After Robot admits that he saw himself in an orgy with every man and woman he ever fought alongside, he realizes that the opposite of war is sex. Heist is accidentally killed in an ensuing confrontation by Gwendolyn. After his death, Klara reads another one of his books, despite calling it \"juvenile twaddle\", because it was"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "never hurt anybody and that he just needs help while Alyah pulls a knife out of the drawer after setting the shotgun down.

If you're spilling tea, it means you're sharing some especially juicy gossip. But if you're over 40, most people are going to assume that you're being literal. They'll think you actually did spill some tea, and rather than lean in close to hear what gossip you have to share, they'll bring you a towel to clean it up. I'm Dead Obviously this slang phrase isn't literal. When someone says \"I'm dead,\" the implication is that whatever has just been said is so funny or true that it's figuratively sent them to an early grave. However, joking about your own premature death is only charming if you're years away from leaving this mortal coil. When somebody over 40 makes such a proclamation, it tends to be a little more worrying. Don't make your friends ask if you were kidding or if you've just received some alarming medical news. Bye, Felicia! First uttered by rapper Ice Cube in the 1995 comedy Friday, \"Bye, Felicia!\" is a way of telling someone to get out of your face and stop annoying you. Now, you might argue that it's perfectly acceptable to say this slang phrase as it came from a time period (the '90s) in which many people now over 40 were coming of age. What's more, you might remind us that Ice Cube is now 49\u2014so if he can say it, why can't you?

Tomorrow: \"What happened was...\" & other signs that some sneaky-freaky may be going on. \"We need to talk\" and other signs a break up is near Every one knows that \"We need to talk\" means two things: either someone actually needs to talk or someone is about to get placed curbside. But let's take a look at a few other phrases that might spell doom for a relationship: I'm trying not to hurt you - This is generally uttered by someone (male or female) who has already hurt the hell out of you and wants to be let off the hook for it. Furthermore, they will do it again. Also beware of \"I don't want to hurt you\" and \"I hope this doesn't hurt you.\" I'm always confused by this one. If you don't want to hurt someone, take steps to make sure you don't. Am I oversimplifying? I just need space - This means they've already found an alternate space (away from you) and just need you to be aware of it. And the follow-up question to this is, \"Space to do what, with who?\" If any of you have an example where someone \"took some space\" and then came back all excited about the relationship and it worked out -"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2019-30", "text": "into relation with each other, it's surprising how frequently and easily people use the \"wrong\" verb out of these pairings (as all of you have noted).

Now, holding up a knife or a gun or a bomb - THAT would be aggressive. A finger is just a finger like a sign is just a sign. If a finger means something, then a sign can mean something too. For some people, a sign putting a woman presidential candidate in prison is \"fighting words\". What about if a person walks past you and draws their thumb across their neck from left to right? What about if someone pulls up in a car and makes a gun sign with index and forefinger? How about holding their hands in a noose pull, is that just a sign? Anyway, signs can mean things, in this case they clearly meant something, we are talking about it. 1. That's absurd and redneck. 2.

It can also be used when telling a story, to get a surprise effect. In Latin America this gesture is used as a way to say \"Hurry up.\" The Beats (Beatniks) used to snap repeatedly as more reserved \"cooler\" applause. Three snaps in the shape of the letter Z are used to convey superiority or disdain for all others. This is called a \"Z snap\". This has even been expanded to include other letters, such as a W or N. What the Fuck!! This gesture involves bringing all fingers together and squezzing your finger tips tightley together. After you must signify to person directed to by a flick in the wrist, you can either apply this hand guesture with either one or two hands. This is commonley used as a sign to eat in India, but across eastern Europe and some parts of Italy this is a gesture used to tell someone to Fuck off, usually because the person is being destructive or annoying. In Europe, when referring to someone and making this symbol it means they are inferurated, or want to fight about a perticular problem. Clement Moore's version of the Wisperin story first used the now familiar phrase, \"If you want to start something, just give me the sign...,\" in which The Don, upon discovery, made this gesture and winked before vanishing into the night.

Within deaf culture, there is a distinction drawn between signs used to curse versus signs that are used to describe sexual acts. In usage, signs to describe detailed sexual behavior are highly taboo due to their graphic nature. As for the signs themselves, some signs do overlap, but they may also vary according to usage. For example, the sign for \"shit\" when used to curse is different from the sign for \"shit\" when used to describe the bodily function or the fecal matter. Examples The back of dominant open b-handshape flipped out under chin literally means \"so what?\" Using a middle finger as the 'classic' flipping of the bird has a different meaning. In the 1980s, the myth was made that the b-handshape flipped under the chin was a sign of saying \"Fuck you\". Some linguists contend that when the middle finger is used directionally, and pointed at someone or something, it becomes a sign. Another common sign for \"fuck\" uses an \"FK\" abbreviation, signed with an f-handshape changing to a k-handshape, which is referred to as a \"loan sign\". A \"loan sign\" is when a fingerspelled word is modified to leave out letters, form a specific shape, or move in a specific direction to become an actual sign(1). \"Whore,\" \"slut,\" or \"prostitute\" is signed by waving an open hand on the side of the chin front to back (fingers"}], "hoverinfo": "text"}, {"x": [0.12557005882263184, 0.13788379728794098, 0.09745674580335617, 0.1867811530828476, 0.163730189204216, 0.15834106504917145, 0.10287880897521973, 0.15853598713874817, 0.14566554129123688, 0.16577796638011932, 0.18877844512462616, 0.16872240602970123, 0.06890220940113068, 0.08867844194173813, 0.12352383881807327, 0.1963634341955185, 0.20224058628082275, 0.11852717399597168, 0.20628908276557922, 0.18160873651504517, 0.06552664935588837, 0.20403961837291718, 0.20090040564537048, 0.20200952887535095, 0.13185641169548035, 0.07869262248277664, 0.12770386040210724, 0.11643046885728836, 0.19574226438999176, 0.10648755729198456, 0.14381623268127441, 0.23373141884803772, 0.09332509338855743, 0.2108200490474701, 0.18059790134429932, 0.15443149209022522, 0.10439489781856537, 0.13213905692100525, 0.1567898988723755, 0.08384247124195099, 0.20006000995635986, 0.0505160354077816, 0.06896504759788513, 0.1690894067287445, 0.20565758645534515, 0.14837820827960968, 0.12071830779314041, 0.1335805356502533, 0.18497924506664276, 0.16710694134235382, 0.19042158126831055, 0.22848984599113464, 0.16174359619617462, 0.16744717955589294, 0.19604337215423584, 0.20400556921958923, 0.19760827720165253, 0.09899814426898956, 0.1711985319852829, 0.15867523849010468], "y": [0.11379505693912506, 0.09885543584823608, 0.09637343883514404, 0.005563107319176197, 0.08977121114730835, 0.0665750503540039, 0.12190068513154984, 0.10587038099765778, 0.07562337815761566, 0.059397462755441666, 0.09145764261484146, 0.12591901421546936, 0.10779759287834167, 0.12696513533592224, 0.07501465827226639, 0.12277509272098541, 0.1132722720503807, 0.04147140681743622, 0.06962202489376068, 0.09591631591320038, 0.13903376460075378, 0.12556476891040802, 0.09276869893074036, 0.11550644040107727, 0.049909286201000214, 0.15002688765525818, 0.09298165887594223, 0.15545903146266937, 0.044480182230472565, 0.1077735498547554, 0.030382536351680756, 0.10350789874792099, 0.14582215249538422, 0.11263761669397354, 0.14479129016399384, 0.09800241887569427, 0.10107122361660004, 0.1321270614862442, 0.11982492357492447, 0.083416648209095, 0.1296452134847641, 0.1439247727394104, 0.03126126900315285, 0.1263331025838852, 0.1101723462343216, 0.17830896377563477, 0.03492870554327965, 0.09631041437387466, 0.14384973049163818, 0.05545264109969139, 0.14764578640460968, 0.09095889329910278, 0.09590347111225128, 0.0988406240940094, 0.14214399456977844, 0.07900694757699966, 0.11288232356309891, 0.10572163015604019, 0.08075784891843796, 0.043920762836933136], "mode": "markers", "name": "Cluster 9", "marker": {"size": 8, "color": "rgb(188,128,189)"}, "text": ["Document 1007", "Document 1017", "Document 1039", "Document 1043", "Document 1046", "Document 1050", "Document 1059", "Document 1070", "Document 1098", "Document 1099", "Document 1104", "Document 1105", "Document 1106", "Document 1123", "Document 1135", "Document 1137", "Document 1141", "Document 1143", "Document 1164", "Document 1166", "Document 1176", "Document 1179", "Document 1190", "Document 1199", "Document 1201", "Document 1212", "Document 1213", "Document 1221", "Document 1226", "Document 1227", "Document 1238", "Document 1246", "Document 1249", "Document 1274", "Document 1286", "Document 1289", "Document 1291", "Document 1292", "Document 1298", "Document 1303", "Document 1305", "Document 1306", "Document 1309", "Document 1310", "Document 1319", "Document 1327", "Document 1330", "Document 1343", "Document 1369", "Document 1374", "Document 1378", "Document 1380", "Document 1413", "Document 1424", "Document 1427", "Document 1430", "Document 1467", "Document 1471", "Document 1489", "Document 1493"], "customdata": [{"title": "bm25", "text": "it distinguishes from everything else.

Does this analogy hold and is it correct to say that sensation reports and mentalistic expressions in general are topic-neutral, that they refer only to experienced \u2018somethings\u2019? Smart's claim runs as follows: When a person says, \u2018I see a yellowish-orange after-image\u2019, he is saying something like this: \u2018There is something going on which is like what is going on when I have my eyes open, am awake, and there is an orange illuminated in good light in front of me, that is, when I really see an orange\u2019. (And there is no reason why a person should not say the same thing when he is having a veridical sense-datum, so long as we construe the \u2018like\u2019 in the last sentence in such a sense that something can be like itself.) Notice that the italicised words, namely \u2018there is something going on which is like what is going on when\u2019, are all quasi logical or topic neutral words.

How to Do Things With Words is based on lectures given at Oxford between 1951 and 1954, and then at Harvard in 1955. Performative utterance According to J. L. Austin, \"performative utterance\" refers to a not truth-valuable action of \"performing\", or \"doing\" a certain action. For example, when people say \"I promise to do so and so\", they are generating the action of making a promise. In this case, without any flaw (the promise is flawlessly fulfilled), the \"performative utterance\" is \"happy\", or to use J. L. Austin's word, \"felicitous\"; if on the other hand, one fails to do what he or she promised, it can be \"unhappy\", or \"infelicitous\". Notice that performative utterance is not truth-valuable, which means nothing said can be judged based on truth or falsity. There are four types of performatives according to Austin: explicit, implicit, primitive, and inexplicit. \"How to Do Things With Words\", edited by J. O. Urmson and Marina Bissau, records Austin's lectures on this topic. In this book, Austin offers examples for each type of performative mentioned above. For explicit performative, he mentioned \"I apologize\", \"I criticize\" (Page 83), which are so explicit to receivers that it would not make sense for someone to ask \"Does he really mean that?\". Inexplicit performatives are the opposite, where the receiver will have understandable doubts. For a primary performative, the example Austin gave is \"I shall be there\".

What van der Graaf and van Delden call this the not merely as a means principle (NMMP) has achieved mantra-like status in bioethics. 33 To say that a practice treats someone merely as a means is generally viewed as a conversation stopper. Still we need to ask several questions: when do we treat people merely as a means? Is the principle sound? Does it do moral work not done by other moral principles? And does the best account of NMMP support CR or condemn coercive participation? As is often pointed out, no sensible moral principle could prohibit using people as a means. In general, we do not treat people wrongly or merely as a means if they consent to the terms of an interaction. The taxi driver uses me as a means to earn an income and I use him as a means to get to my destination. But we do not treat each other merely as a means if we both give valid consent to the terms of the transaction-he does not deceive me about the fare and I do not make a false promise to pay him. It is not clear whether valid consent is always sufficient to satisfy NMMP. For example, it might be thought that a customer treats a prostitute merely as a means even if the interaction is consensual. I think this is doubtful, but, in any case, consent surely goes much of the way towards satisfying NMMP.

The apple is surely his when he swallows it, when he chews it, when he bites into it, when he brings it to his mouth, etc.: it became his as soon as he mixed his labour with it (by picking it from the tree). This does not yet say why an individual is allowed to take from the common store of nature. There is a necessity to do so to eat, but this does not yet establish why others must respect one's property, especially as they labour under the like necessity. Locke assures his readers that the state of nature is a state of plenty: one may take from communal store if one leaves a) enough and b) as good for others, and since nature is bountiful, one can take all that one can use without taking anything from someone else.

In one institute's instructional documents, teachers are advised to avert their eyes when a resident is speaking as a nonverbal signal to address the other residents instead of the teacher. If that does not work, teachers are advised to ask the resident why they are addressing the teacher instead of the group. Many teachers, however, are adamant that active teacher participation is exactly what creates educational value. In their view, it is unproductive not to let residents solicit teacher contributions because the teacher is usually an expert on the topic at hand and even on how such discussions should proceed. The third example is to actively engage residents in the discussion. This could involve encouraging a silent resident to participate, for example by telling them \"I'm missing your input\" (F897).

The first such solution, suggested to me by Andreas Albertsen, depends on a particular interpretation of the core luck egalitarian commitment. I have presented luck egalitarianism as saying that whatever results from the properly situated exercise of choice is not thereby unjust. However, Albertsen suggests understanding the luck egalitarian commitment as saying that 'our relative position should reflect our exercise of responsibility'. This would mean that at some point, a luck egalitarian could insist that an individual's position is no longer proportionate to their exercise of responsibility. My view is that this is not what most luck egalitarians mean and is anyway not an attractive solution. Such a view implies not only that it is not unjust if some are worse off than others through their free choices, but that it is unjust if some are equally well off despite their free, reckless choices.

Alternatively, the theory of practopoiesis suggests that the global workspace is achieved in the brain primarily through fast adaptive mechanisms of nerve cells.

For example, in English, talk and resign in the sentence \"You talk and you resign\" are unergative verbs, since they are intransitive (one does not say \"you talk someone\") and \"you\" are the initiator or responsible for talking and resigning. But fall and die in the sentence \"They fall and die\" are unaccusative verbs, since usually they are not responsible for falling or dying but still the verb is intransitive, meaning it is comprehensively used without a direct object. (They cannot \"fall something\" or \"die someone\"). Some languages treat unergative verbs differently from other intransitives in morphosyntactic terms. For example, in some Romance languages, such verbs use different auxiliaries when in compound tenses. Besides the above, unergative verbs differ from unaccusative verbs in that in some languages, they can occasionally use the passive voice. In Dutch, for example, unergatives take (to have) in the perfect tenses: \"I call (by phone). \u2013 I have called.\" In such cases, a transition to an impersonal passive construction is possible by using the adverb er, which functions as a dummy subject and the passive auxiliary : literally, \"*There is by Jan telephoned.\" (meaning \"A telephone call by Jan is going on.\") By contrast, Dutch ergative verbs take (\"to be\") in the perfect tenses: \"The grease solidifies \u2013 The grease has solidified.\" In that case, no passive construction with is possible.

The use of vocabulary is indeed one of the most important conditions for good and effective writing. The lack of vocabulary means that someone sometimes does not write what he or she will say because he or she has difficulty choosing the most suitable words that correspond to Indonesian words. According to Pincas (1987), a writer does several things to express his opinion in writing. He arranges his ideas into a sentence, then sorts the sentence into paragraphs and uses it to construct the entire essay, the story. They are all made with special words, sentences, sentences and paragraphs that actually relate to each other. Based on this statement, it is necessary to use some activities to improve the students' vocabulary so that they can write their idea using an appropriate and comprehensive vocabulary. Nunan (1989) discovered that some of the successful conditions for writing are to control the mechanics of letter information, to control and to follow the convention of English spelling and punctuation, using the grammatical system to convey the intended meaning. However, students still cannot use mechanical elements such as spelling and punctuation while writing. The most common problems were the spelling of words such as \"swemming\" instead of \"swimming\" or \"village together\". They sometimes make some mistakes when using such conventions. Therefore, a lot of practice is required at this point to improve their skills in this case.

Is there such a thing as an aesthetic \"percept\" to begin with? It is clear enough that, when an autist perceives, even if only by means of mental representation, that someone has a green thumb, it is perfectly appropriate to speak of perception. On the other hand, when someone experiences that same phrase as a metaphor, that object of perception disappears, as by sleight of hand. It vanishes, to be replaced, in a mental manoeuvre, by something that is not at all \"perceived.\" Exactly what that is no one can say: it is the secret of metaphor, perhaps of the aesthetic as such; a palimpsest of words over meaning. (I have spoken before of the \"tenor,\" in the background, that cannot be exorcised from metaphor.) What becomes apparent, though, is that such a metaphor is essentially verbal, not visual: in the phrase \"John has a green thumb,\" we do not visualize a thumb, much less a green one. In the metaphor these words, important as they are, are in the service of something else; they lose their denotational value or competence. The material, or perceptual, content of the words is elided. It is true that different metaphors evoke different degrees of visualization, from \"chew the fat\" or \"green thumb,\" to the situation in which Odysseus, clutching at pebbles to avoid being swept out to sea, is compared to an octopus.

We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, \"war games\". These are all different uses of the word \"games\". Wittgenstein also gives the example of \"Water!\", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or as an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game within which it is being used. Another way Wittgenstein puts the point is that the word \"water\" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as code by members of a secret society. Wittgenstein does not limit the application of his concept of language games to word-meaning. He also applies it to sentence-meaning. For example, the sentence \"Moses did not exist\" (\u00a779) can mean various things.

In crafting said definition, the interpreter identifies three pieces, which he believes to be vital to this consideration: that justification is dependent upon covenant language, that it utilises law-court language, functioning within the covenantal setting as a strong explanatory metaphor of justification, and that it cannot be understood within a Pauline context as separate from eschatology. Through the inclusion of covenant language, justification alludes to the presence of sin and wickedness in the world and the way in which the covenant was instituted to bring about salvation. Within this context, the law-court metaphorical language acknowledges God's role as judge who is to put the world to rights, to deal with evil and to restore justice and order to the cosmos. Finally, Wright's definition of \u2018justification\u2019 within Paul's letters acknowledges that the term is not associated, as has commonly been perceived, with one's personal needs necessary to attain salvation, but instead with what marked someone as a member of God's people.

In this case, religious utterances are criticized as amounting to statements that fail to be confirmed by any scientific evidence. Wittgenstein points out that a person who adopts a viewpoint according to which scientific evidence can confirm or falsify religious utterances is operating on entirely different plane from a religious person -there is, as it were, a gulf separating them: Suppose someone were a believer and said: \"I believe in a Last Judgement,\" and I said: \"Well, I'm not so sure.

My proposal is that if the experience of a mood is a cluster of feelings, we can introduce feelings to the debate on music and mood. This provides a new account of musical moods, one which meets Kivy's and Zangwill's objections. The idea is that each mood is associated with a specific cluster of feelings. This does not mean that if you experience feelings X, Y, and Z it is necessarily implied that you have mood M. Every mood is different, and denominating moods is not a matter of logical inference. We usually find it hard to precisely describe every specific feeling we are experiencing. Nevertheless, if someone says that she in a \"energetic\" mood, we can get a sense of which feelings she might have. I will argue that music evokes certain feelings which can be associated with a specific mood. So I need to show that bodily feelings can be directed at the music and that clusters of these feelings are part of the aesthetic experience of the music.

This in turn provides a principled motivation for my proposed restriction of knowability to non-epistemic statements. Anti-realism and the knowability paradox As the labels will be used here, 'realism' and 'anti-realism' denote views about meaning and truth. The views agree that the meaning of a declarative statement is given by its truth-conditions-how things must stand if the statement is to be true. They disagree about how to understand the notion of truth involved in such a theory of meaning. Anti-realism gives an epistemic characterization of truth such that a statement is true if and only if someone could, at least in principle, come to know it. Realism places no such constraints on truth, holding that a statement can be true independently of whether or not someone could, even in principle, come to know it. Anti-realism can be captured in the following principle 3 : (AR) \u03c6 \u2194 K \u03c6 K is our epistemic operator. It says 'someone knows, at some time, that'.

External power When power is regarded as a force located outside a dialogical process oriented toward reaching understanding, it is an external condition of the dialogue. Therefore, it is called external power. It is what Carspecken (1999) refers to as coercive power or coercion in communicative action. External power should be neutralized or the dialogue will be distorted. Suppose, for instance, someone asks me to read a paper she has worked on. After a couple of weeks when we met, the person inquires excitingly, \"What did you think about my paper?\" Seeing me remain silent, the person adds, \"It was the third revision I made. Hopefully, it would be accepted this time.\" Showing impatience, I comment, \"I thought it was only the first draft.\" Considering my status as a university professor, the person begins to doubt her own ability and concurs, \"I guess I'd better redo it.\" In this case, my status had an impact on the dialogue.

In my opinion, such a question lies at the root of consciousness much more than the complexity problem discussed by others (see below).

The ionosphere consists of \u201cions,\u201d a shell of electrons and electrically charged atoms and molecules. Because ions are created through sunlight interacting with the atoms and molecules in the very thin upper atmosphere, the density (thickness and consistency) of the ionosphere varies from day to night. The ionosphere bends radio signals, similar to the way water will bend light signals. That is why you can hear AM radio broadcasts from far away at night. Also, ham radio operators rely on the ionosphere to bounce their signals from their station to the far reaches of the globe. Since GNSS is a radio signal, its measurements are slightly impacted by ionosphere changes, resulting in small increases in position error. For all except very precise GNSS users, these changes are negligible. Note that a total eclipse of the sun is similar to our day-night cycle, only very much faster. So, while the ionosphere will be more dynamic during an eclipse, it will not cause a loss of the GNSS signal.

(NASA/JSC) The ionosphere is a shell of charged particles (electrons and ions), called plasma, that is produced by solar radiation and energetic particle impact.

Indeed, in order to have a good communication it is expected that the BER is at least 5 10 bit s The modelling of the ionosphere is performed using first-order approximations taken from [29]. The ionosphere is the upper part of the atmosphere where charged particles are mixed with neutral particles. The charged particles are created by photoionisation caused by incoming UV and X-radiation from the Sun: gas molecules are heated, and electrons are liberated then. The rate of this ionisation depends on the density of gas molecules and the intensity of the radiation. In the neutral atmosphere charged particles are practically absent, since the created charged particles are recombined rapidly due to the high density of particles. In the ionosphere, however, only the charged particles can influence the propagation of radio waves. Mainly, the free electrons affect the propagation since the free ions are much heavier than the electrons. The interaction of the ionosphere with the navigation signal can be decomposed into four sources of delay called first-order, second-order, third-order delay, and geometrical signal bending denoted respectively as (1) i , (2) i , (3) i and \u03ba [29].

Ionospheric structure in the $w$-direction causes, to lowest order, radial stretching or squeezing of the ionospheric scattering point spread function but leaves its tangential structure invariant. Correcting for the thickness of the ionosphere can thus be reduced (to lowest order) to determining a single number, i.e.\\ the level of stretching or squeezing. \\item Residual speckle, which can not be corrected in short time integrations, causes a diffuse intensity halo around bright sources beyond a certain distance from the source. Whereas longer integrations probe more of the total scattered flux of the ISP, because of its very steep intensity decline away from the source, these longer integrations also cause smearing of the instantaneous speckle pattern due to variations of the ionosphere. This halo (``seeing'') and related speckle noise might therefore pose a fundamental limitation on the ability to reach the thermal noise level in interferometers at very low frequencies after long total integrations. \\item Long baselines substantially help in correcting for the effects of the largest wave modes of the ionosphere, as seen inside the field of view"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2020-05", "text": "awareness, and geolocation related to national security.

The OMEGA system consisted of eight transmitters located throughout the world. Airplanes and ships used the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system gave navigators information that was inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators had been alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm was in progress, they could have switched to a backup system. GNSS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere, causing the satellite signals to scintillate (like a twinkling star).

This phenomenon, known as scintillation, is governed by the space weather conditions, time of the day, season, local distribution of the geomagnetic field, etc. All these factors make ionospheric scintillation both highly variable in space and time. Moreover, scintillation are intrinsically anisotropic since the associated scattering irregularities tend to align and stretch along the geomagnetic field lines. Depending on the relative position of signal source, the receiving station, and the irregularity, the scintillation effect on the transmitted wave might be enhanced or reduced. This study is focused on the consistent accounting of this geometric effect in scintillation modeling with the emphasis on situations when the communication or sensing sender-receiver link is nearly horizontal. For this task the single phase screen model has been used to model the scattering of propagating radio signals on random ionospheric layer. The geometric enhancement effect of scintillation is demonstrated by considering communication links via a geostationary beacon satellite over the equator.

This phenomenon is called \"ionospheric scintillation\" or simply \"scintillation\", and it leads to the deterioration of communication quality between the ground and satellites and the disturbance of image data transmitted from satellites. This phenomenon has been known for a long time and affects satellite communications such as Inmarsat in Japan (Karasawa et al. 1985). In addition, during the US Army's al-Qaeda sweeping operation \"Operation Anaconda\" in Afghanistan in March 2002, the UHF satellite communication (SATCOM) failure caused fatalities among US troops. It has been pointed out that a plasma bubble may have caused the failure (Kelly et al. 2014). The higher the frequency, the smaller the effect of ionospheric scintillation. It is almost negligible in satellite communication systems with frequencies above 10 GHz compared with other effects such as the troposphere. On the other hand, in satellite communication systems of the L-band at 1.5 GHz and the S band at 2 GHz, the effect of scintillation due to plasma bubbles cannot be ignored. The longer the radio wave propagation path through the plasma bubble, which usually extends in the north-south direction along the magnetic field line, the greater the effect becomes. Therefore, in Japan, it is considered that communication with GEO satellites and other low-elevation-angle satellites could be greatly affected by plasma bubbles (Karasawa et al. 1985).

Wide area navigation (RNAV), which uses radio waves including GNSS, enables shorter aviation routes than those determined by previous navigation methods. Therefore, the installation of RNAV is being promoted and its use is expanding. Code positioning, one type of single-frequency positioning using a pseudo-range, is used in aviation navigation. The effect of the ionospheric delay is large in single-frequency positioning. Ionospheric disturbances such as ionospheric positive storms and plasma bubbles increase range-finding errors and degrade positioning accuracy. In addition, ionospheric scintillation reduces the number of usable satellites and the positioning accuracy. An augmentation system corrects the deterioration of accuracy and provides reinforcement information including integrity information to ensure safety even in rarely occurring worst cases. On the other hand, the augmentation system corrects the ionospheric delay using the data at GPS reference stations, so the local gradient of the ionospheric delay causes an additional error. However, the evaluation of these effects on aviation positioning is very difficult, because the required performance of navigation systems depends on the flight phase and the architecture and design of the specific navigation system. Therefore, the impacts on aeronautical navigation are left unlabeled (white) in Table 2.

By consequence, under these perturbed conditions coming from the outer space, the ionosphere may become highly turbulent and the probability of irregularities formation, typically enhancements or depletions of the electron density embedded in the ambient ionosphere, increases. Such irregularities cause diffraction effects, mainly due to the random fluctuations of the refractive index of the ionosphere, on the satellites signals passing through them and consequent perturbations may cause GNSS navigation errors and outages, abruptly corrupting its performance. Due to the morphology of the geomagnetic field, whose lines are almost vertical at high latitude, polar areas are characterized by the presence of significant ionospheric irregularities having scale sizes ranging from hundreds of kilometres down to a few centimetres and with highly dynamic structures.

There are many such systems in place and they are generally named or described based on how the GPS sensor receives the information. Some systems transmit additional information about sources of error (such as clock drift, ephemeris, or ionospheric delay), others provide direct measurements of how much the signal was off in the past, while a third group provide additional navigational or vehicle information to be integrated in the calculation process. Examples of augmentation systems include the Wide Area Augmentation System, Differential GPS, Inertial Navigation Systems and Assisted GPS. ### Precise monitoring The accuracy of a calculation can also be improved through precise monitoring and measuring of the existing GPS signals in additional or alternate ways.

The significant increase in high-energy electrons within the magnetosphere during strong geomagnetic storms means more electrons will penetrate the shielding on a spacecraft and accumulate within its electronics. This buildup of electrons can discharge in what is basically a small lightning strike and damage electronics.

For starters, HAARP\u2019s IRI has not been operated since September 3, he says. But even if the IRI had been on during the early days of the Mars mission, the beam couldn\u2019t have had any real impact on the craft. The beam\u2019s energy, although strong enough to affect overflying airplanes, which have an operating ceiling of about 26 kilometers (in Earth\u2019s stratosphere), is too diffuse by the time it reaches the ionosphere, part of the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere. Phobos\u2013Grunt\u2019s orbit has been between 200 and 400 kilometers. It turns out that the beam is indeed diffuse at that height. The maximum energy that Phobos\u2013Grunt could have felt from HAARP would have equaled a power density of 1.03 milliwatts per square centimeter, according to Selcher.

It usually manifests as surface charging and/or internal charging. When charge is built up either in the outside (surface) material or in the material (internal), an electrostatic discharge (ESD) can occur when the electric field exceeds the breakdown strength of the material. If the discharge occurred at or near a sensitive component, these ESD currents can cause compromised function and/or catastrophic destruction of sensitive electronics, solar array failures, uncommanded change in system states (phantom commands), loss of synchronization in timing circuits, spurious mode switching, power-on resets, erroneous sensor signals, telemetry noise, and/or loss of data. Other concerns with discharges are possible electromagnetic interference and material damage. Electromagnetic interference can produce noise levels in receive bands that exceed the receiver sensitivity, communications issues due to the excess noise, or phantom commands or signals. ESDs can damage mission-critical materials, including thermal control coatings, reentry thermal protection systems, and optical materials such as dielectric coatings and mirror surfaces.

A related subject, space weather, deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, ionosphere and geomagnetic field, giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies. Effects on spacecraft can arise from radiation, space debris and meteoroid impact, upper atmospheric drag and spacecraft electrostatic charging. Radiation in space usually comes from three main sources: The Van Allen radiation belts Solar proton events and solar energetic particles; and Galactic cosmic rays. For long-duration missions, the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is also radiation-induced \"single-event effects\" such as single event upset. Crewed missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the International Space Station is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts. During solar energetic events (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in times as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to logic circuits, and even hazards to astronauts.

The barrier, which comes and goes, is the result of very low frequency radio communications interacting with particles in space, which results in a sort of shield protecting Earth from high energy radiation in space. This, scientists say, is potentially very good news, as we could use the barrier to protect Earth from extreme space weather resulting from events like coronal mass ejections\u2014huge explosions on the sun, where plasmas and magnetic field are ejected from its corona, the outermost part of its atmosphere. These ejections can result in geomagnetic storms, which have the potential to knock out communication satellites and power grids. NASA scientists detected the barrier with the Van Allen Probes, which are designed to study electrons and ions in our new-space environment. Normally, very low frequency (VLF) signals from radio telescopes are transmitted from the ground and are used to communicate with submarines, deep below the surface of the ocean. However, they also end up going into the atmosphere. The result is a massive \u201cVLF bubble\u201d enshrouding Earth, NASA said.

Brief history of re-entry thermal protection The earliest techniques for re-entry, used during the Apollo era, were more rudimentary. The idea of adding more material to absorb the heat generated was one such example. This meant more weight had to be carried to space and it certainly was one of the expensive implementations. The Apollo heat shield was the beginning of a long race for a safer, cheaper, and more convenient thermal protection system.

The stratosphere only extends for about 100 miles above sea level. Since a rocket takes off vertically it will clear the stratosphere in less than 8 minutes and way before it has the speed to cause any appreciable friction in said part of atmosphere. The re-entry spacecraft, on the other hand, is using the atmosphere to slow down from orbital velocity. It needs to slow from 8 to 10 km/sec to a much slower speed in which to either deploy parachute or land on an extended runway. This is a very significant reduction in speed and the friction in the atmosphere is what accomplishes this reduction. Since friction causes heat and it will have to spend considerable time in atmosphere to work off the speed, an evaporative tile heat shield is necessary. 0tyranny 0poverty0tyranny 0poverty Not the answer you're looking for?

Given the high speed of the object, traveling at 7.7 Kilometers per second, air in front of the craft is compressed creating a shock wave layer in which some of the molecules are separated into ions, creating the typical visible plasma layer that can be present even minutes before disintegration starts. The Entry Point, as defined by USSTRATCOM and represented in all their data, refers to the spacecraft passing 80 Kilometers in altitude where drag builds up to a destructive force, triggering the onset of the disintegration of the spacecraft structure. The shock wave layer forming just in front of the spacecraft and any separated components leads to considerable heating that causes the incineration of the majority of the spacecraft structure. The mechanical deceleration experienced during re-entry can be up to 20Gs further crushing the structural components and causing the break-up of the spacecraft. The mechanical energy of a re-entering satellite is ~3.2 x 10^7 J/kg which would be sufficient to easily vaporize the entire satellite if all of this energy were converted into heat entirely absorbed by the satellite structure.

They suffer aerodynamic heating just like everything else. However, there is a major different: direction. As you are accelerating upwards, you are traveling through thinner and thinner atmosphere, faster and faster. These partially cancel each other out, keeping your heating reasonable. On the way down, you are traveling into thicker and thicker atmosphere, and must dissipate the heat as you go. If you were, say, fired from a railgun, you'd experience the greatest heating at the start, where you are going very fast at low altitudes (thick atmosphere).

So, the spacecraft is forced to re-enter at an angle to the horizontal of between 5.2o and 7.2o. This small angular corridor is called the re-entry window. If the astronauts re-enter at too shallow an angle, the spacecraft will bounce off the atmosphere back into space. If the astronauts re-enter at too steep an angle, both the g-forces and the heat generated will be too great for the crew to survive.

Image credits: Space We all know that that a meteor burns up when it enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is due to the extreme heat generated due to friction with Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This can be dangerous when planning for space travel at extremely high speed. So, while planning for space programs, scientists take special precautions to protect the spaceship from heat. So, what causes the atmosphere to heat up while a spacecraft re-enters? The most common answer would be friction. While friction does play a role in a later part, the heat produced just as the spacecraft re-enters is actually due to compressive heating. During re-entry, the spacecraft arrives at a speed of about 17,000 miles per hour. As the spacecraft enters the atmosphere at such a high speed, it heavily compresses the air in front of it and pushes the air off to the side. This compression raises the air temperature as high as 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit! As the compressed air heats up, the expanding air cools down (according to the Ideal Gas Law).

Is there a similar problem when it is going the other way, at take off? It is going through the same amount of air and acceleration looks quite similar to deceleration, only the other way around.\" The only answer that I could think of is that a good part of the acceleration might take place at higher altitudes where there is less air, and braking is done only by using the atmosphere. Going up, it is the rocket engine which provides acceleration and energy. Because air resistance robs energy and is undesirable, the rocket deliberately rises vertically, to go though the denser atmosphere as quickly as possible.

Therefore, you can't simply dismiss satellites as far less massive than rocket propellants and therefore declare the impact of re-entry negligible compared to the the impact of launch. Much of a satellite material is metal, which will deposit rather quickly (see next question), but other materials could in theory have an impact (John et al. considered paint and concluded its impact was negligible). Some satellites contain unusual materials: for example, Kosmos 1402 was a Soviet spy satellite containing a nuclear reactor and thus fuel. Leifer et al (1987) have shown that more than a year after Cosmos-1402 deorbited a 53\u00b120% excess of 235U was measured at an elevation of 36 km. I don't know what happened since then.

The shuttles were gliders, meaning they were able to adjust their flight pattern to help reduce the amount of heat building up including S turns, making re-entry not too dissimilar from landing in an airplane. First, the shuttle flew backward to slow down from orbit speed, and then the orbital maneuvering engines (OMS) would thrust it out of orbit and toward Earth. Next, the shuttle turned nose-first once out of orbit and entered the atmosphere with its belly down toward the atmosphere to use drag along its blunt bottom to help slow it down and then pull the nose up to about 40 degrees. It utilized S turns and other flight patterns to increase drag, reduce speed, and reduce the heat that built up from the re-entry into the atmosphere.

The stratosphere only extends for about 100 miles above sea level. Since a rocket takes off vertically it will clear the stratosphere in less than 8 minutes and way before it has the speed to cause any appreciable friction in said part of atmosphere. The re-entry spacecraft, on the other hand, is using the atmosphere to slow down from orbital velocity. It needs to slow from 8 to 10 km/sec to a much slower speed in which to either deploy parachute or land on an extended runway. This is a very significant reduction in speed and the friction in the atmosphere is what accomplishes this reduction. Since friction causes heat and it will have to spend considerable time in atmosphere to work off the speed, an evaporative tile heat shield is necessary. 0tyranny 0poverty0tyranny 0poverty Not the answer you're looking for?

Once the spacecraft has been carefully navigated to fall through the re-entry corridor, the thermodynamics comes into play. The air, as we know, is composed of mainly two diatomic molecules: oxygen and nitrogen. Ordinarily, when air pressure is low, they remain in this diatomic state. However, under special circumstances like atmospheric re-entry, they behave differently. During re-entry, as the spacecraft falls under gravity and enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the increasing density of the atmosphere combined with the tremendous speed of the spacecraft (of the order of 7-8,000 metres per second) causes a shock wave leading to an enormous rise in the pressure in front of it. At approximately 70 to 80 km above Earth, this pressure becomes so large that it causes the diatomic oxygen and (after some time) nitrogen to split causing further reactions. These reactions are extremely exothermic \u2013 meaning they release a lot of heat. This heat is so significant that we need special arrangements to protect what\u2019s inside the spacecraft. During this crucial period of high energy thermodynamic reactions, the spacecraft continues to fall and slow down gradually.

The D'Alembert's inertial forces created in the vehicle's structure during such changes of trajectory would kill the crew and destroy the antigravitational vehicle. One of the most serious problems resulting from the repulsion of the antigravitational spacecraft from every other object would be the impossibility of reaching the surface of heavier planets after leaving from lighter heavenly bodies. For example, having started from Earth the spacecraft would not be able to reach Jupiter or Saturn, whereas after starting from the Moon it would not be able to reach Earth. The reason for this is that the velocity gained by the vehicle during its interaction with the field of a lighter planet would not be sufficient to break through the sphere of the stronger repulsion from a heavier planet. Therefore it is possible that such a spacecraft once launched would never achieve its destination, and would also be unable to return.

During the first seconds of the launch, the rocket climbs almost vertically to exit the denser part of the atmosphere. Quite quickly, however, the rocket tilts to gain horizontal speed: a spacecraft needs to travel at almost 8km/s to stay in low orbit (just above 200km in altitude). When the first stage of Falcon 9 is jettisoned, the rocket is travelling at ten times the speed of sound, 90km above the surface. Without doing anything, the stage would reenter the atmosphere uncontrolled, which would make recovering the stage difficult. On this mission, the stage was flipped around, so that it would travel tail first, a moment after it was dropped. Three engines were relighted before reentry, to slow the stage down, and allow the computer to control orientation during reentry. It may sound easy, but it isn\u2019t. it means keeping control of the stage\u2019s attitude after it has been jettisoned, and igniting a rocket engine is everything but easy. But that burn went well. The second burn is even more tricky: the goal is to relight one engine, when the stage is coming low over the surface, to slow it down and make it touch down gently. This time, the stage is traveling in thick atmosphere, which makes attitude control even more complicated.

On one hand, this occurrence may release unwanted and dangerous debris into orbit, resulting in potential threats to other satellites, if the detached components skip the Earth's atmosphere. On the other hand, this phase of catastrophic decay may have potential benefits in reducing the casualty risk. In fact, a partial disassembly of the spacecraft can expose the internal components to early re-entry heating, and the possible decrease in entry speed and flight-path angle could generate higher heat loads, thus improving the demise. Fig. 6c also shows that a higher number of revolutions is associated with orbits with higher pericentre altitudes and lower eccentricities. As increasing the number of passages through the atmosphere can increase the chance of early breakups, this circularisation phenomenon should be avoided, if the risk of releasing unwanted debris into orbit must be minimised. Re-entry predictions with the overshoot boundary As outlined in Section 3, understanding what are the conditions leading to the final re-entry of the spacecraft required switching from the long-term propagation to the destructive re-entry analysis. This switching is necessary when performing a full demisability and casualty risk analysis. However, it might be a cumbersome procedure when the intention is limited to discerning between the entry/skip behaviour, such as in the design and optimisation of the disposal trajectory and limit the number of low-altitude passages.

But if you get things wrong and your angle is too shallow, you could be in a different kind of trouble. At the speeds involved the diffuse, wispy upper atmosphere of the Earth can seem as solid to your descending craft as the liquid surface of a still pond does to a flat-bottomed pebble expertly skimmed towards it at a similarly shallow angle.

Return from space brings us back once again to the physics of getting there. Remember, your vehicle's velocity must exceed 17,500 miles per hour to stay in orbit. To return to earth, you have no choice but to plunge back into the atmosphere at extremely high speed. As you do, the vehicle smacks into the air in front of you, cramming the gas tightly together and making it enormously hot. While it's comparatively easy to make metal structures that can withstand the physical force of reentry, dealing with the high temperatures is a more difficult engineering challenge. Space vehicles have typically relied on special shapes to move that heat away from vital areas, and special materials are used that can absorb this energy. The Apollo and Soyuz space capsules let their blunt bellies take the heat of reentry before deploying parachutes.

Rather than having conventional wings, some of these spacecraft might be 'lifting bodies' in which the vehicle's curved shape provides the required lift within the atmosphere. Some of them might be launched vertically like rockets and some might fly out to the upper atmosphere like an airplane before making the transition to orbit, as we saw earlier in this chapter. However the same problem remained: all of the energy used to get the craft into orbit would have to be dissipated in order to get it back to Earth. And most of that energy was going to manifest as heat. Which meant all that heat had to be handled somehow. You either had to endure it or get rid of it. Many of these early studies were really concerned with suborbital aircraft rather than true spacecraft: vehicles which could climb to the edge of space without quite enough velocity to actually achieve orbit before flying back down through the atmosphere to a landing halfway round the world.

A consequence of these guidelines is that payload launched into low Earth orbit (LEO) has to be disposed of within 25 years after end of operation. This is achieved by reentry into the atmosphere.

The ESA Clean Space initiative was launched in 2012 to consider the environmental impact of the agency\u2019s missions across their entire life cycle. A primary focus of Clean Space since its earliest days has been mitigating space debris through \u201cdesign for demise.\u201d The goal: making design choices that ensure a spacecraft component has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of surviving reentry and posing a threat to people on the ground.

Instead of relying on modeling software to understand the forces exerted on a specific component during a satellite\u2019s reentry, the team followed their models up with real-world testing. In order to simulate what a satellite and its components would experience during reentry, the team utilized a plasma wind tunnel at German space agency DLR\u2019s facility in Cologne. The wind tunnel is able to mimic the superheated gas, or plasma, that satellites encounter during reentry, subjecting individual components and sections of satellites to several thousands of degrees Celsius.

This paper explores the possibility of modifying the ATR for use in space application as well as during spacecraft re-entry. Such modified ATR\u2019s could be used to power space vehicles up to the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to dock with the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, thrust reversal techniques on the ATR systems could be used to improve the accuracy of Ballistic Missiles and hypersonic space planes upon Re-entry. Challenges faced would be in this type of air breathing engine would be operating at different atmospheric conditions. This paper will explore an ATR design, which will operate at different modes namely conventional mode, which will be used during below absolute ceiling, and the mission mode, which will be employed during flight in vacuum. Lastly, the reentry mode, which can be used for lessening the entry velocity of a vehicle to reduce the risks associated with reentry.

The Reentry Direct Broadcasting Alert System (R-DBAS) is an evolution of the Reentry Breakup Recorder (REBR) concept, often called the black box of spacecraft. But unlike the REBR, which simply downloads data via satellite link for later analysis, the R-DBAS is intended as a direct communication tool with the end user. As a spacecraft carrying R-DBAS hits the atmosphere, it relays a message with the coordinates of the falling debris area to anyone with a receiver and a display, such as a laptop or iPad , warning them of the hazard. Despite increasing efforts to accurately predict space debris reentry, the exact time and location of reentry is still very uncertain. Partially, this is due to a skipping effect uncontrolled spacecraft may undergo as they enter the atmosphere at a shallow angle. Such an effect depends on atmospheric variations of density and winds that are difficult to model. When the skipping ends and atmospheric reentry starts, the trajectory and the overall location of surviving fragments can be precisely predicted but the time to impact the ground or to reach airspace is at that point very short. All of these factors together mean that population centers, ships, and aircraft have very little time to respond to incoming space debris.

Etymology: The word supersonic comes from two Latin derived words; 1) super: above and 2) sonus: sound, which together mean above sound, or faster than sound. Supersonic objects The tip of a bullwhip is thought to be the first object designed to break the sound barrier, resulting in the telltale \"crack\" (actually a small sonic boom). The wave motion travelling through the bullwhip is what makes it capable of achieving supersonic speeds. However, the first man-made supersonic boom was likely caused by a piece of cloth, spurring the whip's eventual development. Most modern firearm bullets are supersonic, with rifle projectiles often travelling at speeds approaching and in some cases well exceeding Mach 3. Most spacecraft are supersonic at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low air densities. During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30 km (~98,400 feet) to reduce air drag. Note that the speed of sound decreases somewhat with altitude, due to lower temperatures found there (typically up to 25 km). At even higher altitudes the temperature starts increasing, with the corresponding increase in the speed of sound. When an inflated balloon is burst, the torn pieces of latex contract at supersonic speed, which contributes to the sharp and loud popping noise.

Recently, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and many universities have cooperated to develop a membrane reentry vehicle with an inflatable torus. The target vehicle is sent into a predetermined orbit by a sounding rocket, and the membrane expands rapidly and is maintained by the inflatable torus under vacuum and microgravity conditions. After the highest point of the orbit, the vehicle returns to the atmosphere. It is worth noting that the expanded membrane has a flotation effect during the descent, so vehicle does not need to install a parachute, which can ensure the vehicle maintains a low ballistic coefficient flight during the whole EDL process by the advantage of its large area and small weight, and reduce the speed when landing to achieve a soft landing. As a new type of return vehicle with multiple reentry advantages in the future, aerospace agencies of various countries have been successively launching a series of studies on this type of reentry vehicle since the 1960s.

Mechanical insulation is commonly installed in industrial and commercial facilities.

Re-entry through the atmosphere generates very high temperatures due to compression of the air at high speeds. Insulators must meet demanding physical properties beyond their thermal transfer retardant properties. Examples of insulation used on spacecraft include reinforced carbon-carbon composite nose cone and silica fiber tiles of the Space Shuttle. See also Insulative paint. Automotive Internal combustion engines produce a lot of heat during their combustion cycle. This can have a negative effect when it reaches various heat-sensitive components such as sensors, batteries, and starter motors. As a result, thermal insulation is necessary to prevent the heat from the exhaust from reaching these components. High performance cars often use thermal insulation as a means to increase engine performance. Factors influencing performance Insulation performance is influenced by many factors, the most prominent of which include: It is important to note that the factors influencing performance may vary over time as material ages or environmental conditions change.

December 15, 2015 6:21 PM Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System Scientists are learning more about how the upper atmosphere and ionosphere affect space satellites as well as communications and navigation here on Earth, thanks to new data from a U.S. Air Force satellite that recently completed a more than seven-year mission. The Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere during a planned reentry on Nov. 28, leaving behind a treasure trove of data about a part of the space environment that's difficult to study. The unique set of sustained observations from C/NOFS will greatly improve models currently used to predict satellite trajectories, orbital drag and uncontrolled re-entry. Scientists from the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the University of Texas (UT) at Dallas are presenting the results at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco. Launched on April 16, 2008, C/NOFS studied a region high above in our atmosphere called the ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles created by ultra-violet radiation from the sun. This layer lies some 40 to 600 miles above the Earth's surface, where it interacts and co-mingles with the neutral particles of the tenuous upper atmosphere. The upper atmosphere and ionosphere change constantly in response to forces from above and below, including explosions on the sun, intense upper atmosphere winds, and dynamic electric field changes. In addition to interfering with satellite orbits, such changes can produce turbulence in the ionosphere that cause what's known as scintillations, which interfere with"}, {"title": "rpj-book", "text": "USA, Spain and Australia.

Finally, as we saw in Chap. , high speed entry into an atmosphere can generate a lot of heat. One consequence of this can be the creation of an envelope of ionized atmospheric gases around the craft, which interferes with or even totally blocks radio communications.

The received telemetry during entry (or played back later) will allow for the performance of the Entry-Descent-Landing technologies to be assessed.

The Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere during a planned reentry on Nov. 28, 2015 leaving behind a treasure trove of data about a part of the space environment that's difficult to study. The unique set of sustained observations from C/NOFS will greatly improve models currently used to predict satellite trajectories, orbital drag and uncontrolled re-entry. Scientists from the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the University of Texas (UT) at Dallas are presenting the results at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco. Launched on April 16, 2008, C/NOFS studied a region high above in our atmosphere called the ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles created by ultra-violet radiation from the sun. This layer lies some 40 to 600 miles above the Earth's surface, where it interacts and co-mingles with the neutral particles of the tenuous upper atmosphere.

Constant exposure to ionising radiation, cosmic rays, and large temperature changes mean that electronic systems need to be designed with shielding, fail-safes, and redundancies in mind. While one would assume that modern spacecraft are filled to the brim with the latest technology, that is rarely the case. The major problem with space missions is that once a craft leaves Earth, there is very little that can be done when things go awry, especially during unmanned missions. That is why it is far more important to use technology that has been tried and tested which means that some of the components that make it into the spacecraft can be years or even decades old. You might ask, why do engineers go to such lengths to put electronic systems on spacecraft? Well, as it turns out, virtually every aspect of modern spaceflight relies on electronics. Key systems like navigation, communications, telemetry, and sensors are made possible thanks to electronics. Moreover, any unmanned missions, which make up the vast majority of space missions, would be impossible without electronics that enable the spacecraft to be controlled from Earth. Taking it a step further, probes that conduct missions in deep space need to be able to make their own, real-time decisions. This also necessitates the use of computers.

In reality most missions at Mars have had communications blackout periods of the order of a month.[23] A satellite at either of the Earth-Sun L4/L5 Lagrange points could serve as a relay during this period to solve the problem; even a constellation of communications satellites would be a minor expense in the context of a full colonization program.

Small spacecraft are more highly resource-constrained by mass, power, volume, delivery timelines, and financial cost relative to their larger counterparts. Small spacecraft are operationally challenging because subsystem functions are coupled and constrained by the limited available commodities (e.g. data, energy, and access times to ground resources). Furthermore, additional operational complexities arise because small spacecraft components are physically integrated, which may yield thermal or radio frequency interference.

The scientific payload, provided by research institutes throughout Europe, consists of seven instruments that provide remote sensing measurements of the atmosphere, ground and below the surface. Since arrival in orbit around Mars in December 2003, Mars Express has been helping to answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere, surface environment, history of water and potential for life on Mars. The Mars Radio Science Experiment (MaRS) uses radio waves to study both the surface and the atmosphere of Mars. It measures local variations of gravity over the surface of the planet as well as providing pressure and temperatures profiles of the atmosphere.

In a worst case scenario an aircraft can lose contact with its surroundings. Oil tankers can struggle with precise navigation. In order to more precisely predict when radio communications and navigation will fail, researchers require more information about what happens when violent solar winds hit the Earth and produce the northern lights. The solar winds consist of charged particles and produce powerful turbulence in the ionosphere, which consists of plasma clouds with electrical particles at an altitude of 80 to 500 km.

But it didn't make it into its final mapping orbit until February 1999. What took so long? Surveyor needed to reach a near-circular, low-altitude orbit in order to map the surface of Mars. In September 1997, the orbit of MGS was far from circular and at its farthest point in orbit, MGS was really far from Mars (56,000 kilometers above the surface)! Mission controllers needed MGS to be only ~400 kilometers above the surface. In order to adjust the orbit of MGS, the controllers used aerobraking. Controllers were going to send MGS through the atmosphere of Mars to slow it down. During these atmospheric passes, air resistance generated by the solar panels would slow the spacecraft and gradually lower its orbit. Surveyor was to use this aerobraking technique to lower the high point of its orbit from the initial 56,000 kilometers in altitude to about 400 kilometers. This aerobraking would also force the spacecraft into a near-circular orbit. Originally, this was only suppose to take 4 months.

The ionospheric plasma is highly variable, changing with the time of day, season, phase of the solar activity cycle, and in response to any transient solar events like flares or coronal mass ejections. As Marconi discovered over a century ago, we can use the ionosphere to help us communicate over long distances.

Can a normal person land a plane? Short answer: maybe, if he or she had plenty of help from air-traffic control and were good at multitasking. In movies, normal people are often put in situations where they have to land a plane. How do satellites survive the thermosphere? Many satellites orbit within the thermosphere and changes in the density of (the very, very thin) air at orbital altitudes, brought on by heating and expansion of the thermosphere, generates a drag force on satellites. These waves and tides help move energy around within the atmosphere, including the thermosphere. How does the ionosphere work? The ionized part of the Earth's atmosphere is known as the ionosphere. Ultraviolet light from the sun collides with atoms in this region knocking electrons loose. This creates ions, or atoms with missing electrons. This process also works in reverse for radio waves produced on the earth. Is the ionosphere hot or cold? Due to fluxes in solar radiation, temperatures in the ionosphere vary from 200 Kelvin (or -99 degrees Fahrenheit) to 500K (or 440 degrees Fahrenheit). Where does the ionosphere start? The ionosphere begins at a height of about 50 km (30 miles) above the surface, but it is most distinct and important above 80 km (50 miles). What is the altitude of the ionosphere?

These layers are a good thing, as they protect us from solar radiation. The ionosphere exists because of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It breaks apart the atmospheric molecules that remain at these altitudes, knocking off electrons, leaving a sea of ions and charged electrons. This region of charged particles exists alongside the very thin upper atmosphere. We need to understand how earth\u2019s weather patterns, including thunderstorms, snow, rain and heat, hurricanes, etc. affect this region, because many low-earth satellites that orbit the Earth, including the International Space Station, fly right through the ionosphere. Interestingly, the ionosphere actually supports some of the radio waves and signals that we rely on, such as GPS signals. When the ionosphere is unpredictably changed, creating ripples and bubbles of dense plasma, the impact on our communication technology can be significant. On the other hand, some signals, like those of short-wave radio, bounce off the ionosphere and rely on it for communications around the globe. Changes in the ionosphere can affect the signals that must go through it, like GPS, and those that bounce off of it, like short wave radio.

This is because at altitudes of higher density, there are more ions and subsequently more possibility for collisions, which are the cause of deionization. In the E and F layers, the density is low enough such that these collisions do not happen as often as in the D layer, meaning that these two layers remain ionized long after radiation has stopped being applied. In fact, they remain ionized throughout the entire night, whereas the D layer loses its ionization during the night. This property of the ionosphere is what allows for radio communication via sky waves. At the ion density of the E and F layers during both day and night, LF and VLF radio waves reflect off of the ions, propagating back down to the surface of the earth. However, the properties of the D layer provide some difficulties. During the day, the ion density is too high for some LF, and especially VLF, radio waves to pass through to then be reflected off of the E or F layers. Instead, the waves are absorbed by the ions. During the night, the ion density is low enough for LF and VLF radio waves to pass through it undisturbed, and reach the reflective E and F layers. Brody, K., & Lukes, L., Dr. (n.d.).

Ionization, the process in which electrons are stripped from atoms and produces electrically charged particles, results from solar radiation. When the ionosphere becomes heavily ionized, the gases may even glow and be visible. This phenomenon is known as Northern and Southern Lights. \u2022 Why is the ionosphere important in HF radio? Well, this blanket of gases is like nature\u2019s satellite, making HF BLOS radio communications possible. When radio waves strike these ionized layers, depending on frequency, some are completely absorbed, others are refracted so that they return to the earth, and still others pass through the ionosphere into outer space. Absorption tends to be greater at lower frequencies, and increases as the degree of ionization increases. \u2022 The angle at which sky waves enter the ionosphere is known as the incident angle. This is determined by wavelength and the type of transmitting antenna. Like a billiard ball bouncing off a rail, a radio wave reflects from the ionosphere at the same angle it hits it. Thus, the incident angle is an important factor in determining communications range. If you need to reach a station that is relatively far from you, you would want the incident angle to be relatively large. To communicate with a nearby station, the incident angle should be relatively small. Ground station HF radio operators worry about the angle of incidence as"}, {"title": "pes2o", "text": "Sun. As the ionization of the upper layers of the ionosphere is strongly dependent on the Sun's radiation, the ionosphere varies both daily and seasonally. Because the energy from the Sun varies both daily and seasonally, the ionosphere is never static. The Sun, for instance, has times of extreme activity that causes storms and severe disruption to the propagation. Moreover, the ionosphere's behavior is affected by even more parameters, such as the height and the mixture of gasses [17]. This chemistry that was just mentioned also directly affects the rate of ionization, just as the density of atoms and the intensity of radiation do. Some chemical reactions take place quickly, causing high ionization, while others are slower, resulting in less ionization [10]. All the ionization that was explained illustrates the ionosphere's interaction with radio waves. When a radio wave reaches the ionosphere, the electric field in the wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radiofrequency energy is released due to this resonant oscillation, on which the oscillating electrons may either recombine, thereby losing the radio energy, or re-radiate the original wave energy (refraction) [17]. The refraction phenomenon is fundamental in all ionospheric links, and it occurs because ionized molecules present free electrons that are able to vibrate in response to the radio signals reaching them. The behavior of each of these moving electrons resembles small dipole antennas. Radio waves are bent away from areas of high ionization because these areas have a lower"}, {"title": "math", "text": "A plasma is formed, which consists of negative free electrons and positive ions. The part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation is called the ionosphere . At the same time that ionisation takes place however, an opposing process called recombination also begins. Some of the free electrons are drawn to the positive ions, and combine again with them if they are in close enough contact. Since the gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process occurs more often here because the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The ionisation process produces energy which means that the upper parts of the thermosphere, which are dominated by ionisation, have a higher temperature than the lower layers where recombination takes place. Overall, temperature in the thermosphere increases with an increase in altitude. ## The ionosphere and radio waves The ionosphere is of practical importance because it allows radio waves to be transmitted. A radio wave is a type of electromagnetic radiation that humans use to transmit information without wires. When using high-frequency bands, the ionosphere is used to reflect the transmitted radio beam. When a radio wave reaches the ionosphere, the electric field in the wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave.

In the high atmosphere, above about 50 kilometers (30 miles), the air particles are separated so far that collisions between them are far less frequent than in the lower atmosphere, and when an air particle is ionized by ultraviolet radiation from the sun it remains ionized for a considerable time. Therefore at any given time a large proportion of the air particles are in an ionized condition. This does not occur much below about 50 kilometers (30 miles), because the ionizing radiations from the sun are largely absorbed in the higher regions of the atmosphere. Likewise there is not very great ionization density above about 400 kilometers (250 miles), because the air is so rare at such heights that there are not enough atoms to provide for great ionization density. The region in which the ionization is great, great enough in fact to affect radio wave transmission, is thus between 50 and 400 kilometers (30 and 250 miles) above the earth's surface, and this region is called the \"ionosphere\".

Communicating with a point halfway round the planet using HF is like trying to play that old 70's children's game called Rebound. Since radio links are usually close to or distinctly line of sight links, communicating with a point on the other side of a sphere would seem like a fairly insurmountable problem. I'd think the first time this problem was solved using the ionosphere it was probably an accident caused by some early radio pioneers receiving signals for their fellow pioneers some way round the planet and beginning to wonder why and how it was happening. The reason it was and does happen is because of a thin layer of the Earths atmosphere called the ionosphere. The ionosphere is a region of the upper atmosphere, from about 85 km (53 mi) to 600 km (370 mi) altitude, and includes the thermosphere and parts of the mesosphere and exosphere.

It is a perturbing medium for transionospheric radio signals measured by Earth-based radio telescopes, which suffer from phase corruption. To perform sensitive measurements at low radio frequencies, it is necessary to accurately calibrate the ionosphere-induced path length differences from the measured signal. \\par The ionosphere consists of partially ionized plasma, which extends from about 60\\,km to beyond 1000\\,km altitude, transitioning smoothly into the plasmasphere. The ionosphere is formed as X-ray, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light from the Sun provides the energy that ionizes the atoms and molecules present in the upper atmosphere. At nighttime, the recombination process occurs, and the number of electron-ion pairs decrease. Other sources such as cosmic rays, can ionize the atmosphere, though not nearly as strong as the Sun. At night, the electron density peak lies at an altitude of about 250-500\\,km \\citep[see][]{Mannucci1998RaSc...33..565M}. The ionosphere is a highly dynamic region that varies with latitude and time. The electron density changes dramatically from local daytime to nighttime, peaking in the early afternoon and progressively declining after midnight. The electron density increases as one descends in the latitude of both hemispheres, reaching a maximum around the geomagnetic equator with a trough somewhere between the geographic and geomagnetic equators. As a result, the ionospheric activity is continuously varied during the daytime and has unanticipated changes during the nighttime, especially at low-latitude regions ($\\pm$20\\,degree magnetic latitudes). \\par The ionosphere has been investigated for decades with ionosondes and"}, {"title": "rpj-c4", "text": "which a free electron is \"captured\" by a positive ion if it moves close enough to it. As the gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process accelerates since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The point of balance between these two processes determines the degree of ionization present at any given time. The ionization depends primarily on the Sun and its activity. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly with the amount of radiation received from the sun. Thus there is a diurnal (time of day) effect and a seasonal effect. The local winter hemisphere is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the sun is associated with the sunspot cycle, with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, auroral zones, mid-latitudes, and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization. There are disturbances such as solar flares and the associated release of charged particles into the solar wind which reaches the Earth and interacts with its geomagnetic field. The D layer is the innermost layer, 50 km to 90 km above the surface of the Earth. Ionization here is due to Lyman series-alpha hydrogen radiation at a wavelength of 121.5 nanometre (nm) ionizing nitric oxide (NO).

Amateur radio enthusiasts primarily use this quality of the ionosphere to help propagate lower frequency HF signals around the world: the waves are trapped, bouncing around in the upper layers of the ionosphere until they are refracted down at another point on the Earth. This is called skywave transmission. UHF TV signals are not carried along the ionosphere but can be reflected off of the charged particles down at another point on Earth in order to reach farther than the typical line-of-sight transmission distances; this is the skip distance.

The frequency of these waves depends on how dense the plasma is; denser plasma has a higher intrinsic plasma frequency. For a density of one million electrons per cubic centimeter (typical of Earth\u2019s ionosphere), the plasma frequency comes out to about 9 MHz. This is glossing over a lot of the details of how radio waves interact with a plasma, but the bottom line is that high-frequency radio waves will be reflected at higher altitudes (where the plasma density is greater) than low-frequency radio waves, if they are reflected at all.

At greater heights- intensity of ionizing radiation is very high, few molecules are available for ionization, ionisation density is low As height decreases- more molecules are available due to reduced atmospheric pressure, ionization density is higher (closer to the earth) But as height decreases further, ionization density decreases though more molecules are available since the energy in the ionizing radiation has been used up to create ions.

The E layer, about 50 mi (80 km) above the surface, also exists mainly during the day, although nighttime ionization is sometimes observed. The E layer can provide medium-range radio communication at certain frequencies. The uppermost layers are called the F1 layer and the F2 layer. The F1 layer, normally present only on the daylight side of the earth, forms at about 125 mi (200 km) altitude; the F2 layer exists at about 180 mi (300 km) over most, or all, of the earth.

Communication by means of F-layer propagation can usually be accomplished between any two points on the earth at some frequencies between 5 MHz and 30 MHz. Tropospheric Propagation At frequencies above about 30 MHz, the lower atmosphere bends radio waves toward the surface. Tropospheric banding occurs because the index of refraction of air, with respect to EM waves, decreases with altitude.

The up and down of the ionization is similar to the daily temperature variations on Earth: At sunrise the air heats up; with fading solar radiation it cools down again. In order to ionize atoms and molecules the energy of the radiation must be sufficiently high (at short waves, extreme ultraviolet). By this energy consuming process, dangerous radiation is completely absorbed above 60 km in altitude (about 35 miles). Our atmosphere is also an important protective shield against the dangerous part of the solar radiation, like X-ray radiation. Short-wave X-ray radiation from solar eruptions and charged particles from the solar wind (SWACI Sun) ionize the lower ionosphere at an altitude of 100 km. This additional ionization modifies this layer in a way that affects the propagation of radio waves.

As the gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process accelerates since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The point of balance between these two processes determines the degree of ionization present at any given time. The ionization depends primarily on the Sun and its activity. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly with the amount of radiation received from the sun. Thus there is a diurnal (time of day) effect time and a seasonal effect. The local winter hemisphere is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the sun is associated with the sunspot cycle, with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, auroral zones, mid-latitudes, and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization.

Since the atmosphere is bombarded by ultraviolet light waves of different frequencies, several ionized layers are formed at different altitudes. Lower frequency ultraviolet waves penetrate the atmosphere the least; therefore, they produce ionized layers at the higher altitudes. Conversely, ultraviolet waves of higher frequencies penetrate deeper and produce layers at the lower altitudes. An important factor in determining the density of ionized layers is the elevation angle of the sun, which changes frequently. For this reason, the height and thickness of the ionized layers vary, depending on the time of day and even the season of the year. Recombination Recall that the process of ionization involves ultraviolet light waves knocking electrons free from their atoms. A reverse process called RECOMBINATION occurs when the free electrons and positive ions collide with each other. Since these collisions are inevitable, the positive ions return to their original neutral atom state. The recombination process also depends on the time of day. Between the hours of early morning and late afternoon, the rate of ionization exceeds the rate of recombination. During this period, the ionized layers reach their greatest density and exert maximum influence on radio waves. During the late afternoon and early evening hours, however, the rate of recombination exceeds the rate of ionization, and the density of the ionized layers begins to decrease.

It is appropriately named the ionosphere because it consists of several layers of electrically charged gas atoms called ions. The ions are formed by a process called ionization. Ionization occurs when high energy ultraviolet light waves from the sun enter the ionospheric region of the atmosphere, strike a gas atom, and literally knock an electron free from its parent atom. A normal atom is electrically neutral since it contains both a positive proton in its nucleus and a negative orbiting electron. When the negative electron is knocked free from the atom, the atom becomes positively charged (called a positive ion) and remains in space along with the free electron, which is negatively charged. This process of upsetting electrical neutrality is known as IONIZATION. The free negative electrons subsequently absorb part of the ultraviolet energy, which initially freed them from their atoms. As the ultraviolet light wave continues to produce positive ions and negative electrons, its intensity decreases because of the absorption of energy by the free electrons, and an ionized layer is formed.

During the day, X-rays and UV light from the sun provide energy that continuously knocks electrons from atoms, creating ions and free electrons. These separate particles are constantly colliding, recombining, and becoming electrically neutral atoms again. So at night, without the energy from the sun, more particles combine than are ionized and the ionosphere shrinks.

The ionospheric plasma density and structure affect the reflection and absorption of radio waves in the mid-and short-wave bands, communication and positioning using satellites, and delays and fluctuations of radio waves in the UHF band. Therefore, space weather phenomena in the ionosphere can affect short-wave HF communication/broadcasting used for aviation (Sect. \"Aviation operation\"), VHF communication/broadcasting used for disaster prevention and firefighting radio, and UHF communications used in satellite communications. As mentioned above, effects depend on the system details and usages. Although the role of HF communication/broadcasting is limited owing to its existing use by communication satellites and submarine cables, it is continuously used for aviation radio, ship radio, disaster radio, and long-distance communication such as international radio broadcasting. The ionospheric phenomena that affect HF communication are ionospheric negative storms, the Dellinger phenomenon, PCA, and plasma bubbles. Ionospheric negative storms are an unusual decrease in plasma density. As they are mostly associated with geomagnetic storms, their occurrence is anticipated in periods of medium and high solar activity. During the former, foF2 is typically about 2-8 MHz. If a moderate event (once per year) with ~ 30% plasma decrease occurs during nighttime (daytime), the corresponding MUF for a great-circle distance of 2000 km will typically decrease from about 12-48 to 8.4-34 MHz.

An AM signal is unfortunately more inclined to interferences because of its smaller bandwidth and consequently has worst sound quality than the higher-bandwidth FM signal. It is also more prone to noise which affects amplitude, not frequency. However modulation and demodulation of AM signal is less complicate than in FM systems, and consequently AM is nevertheless widely used.

This can be very useful for long-distance communication, but can also interfere with local stations. Due to the limited number of available channels in the MW broadcast band, the same frequencies are re-allocated to different broadcasting stations several hundred miles apart. On nights of good skywave propagation, the signals of distant stations may reflect off the ionosphere and interfere with the signals of local stations on the same frequency. The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) sets aside certain channels for nighttime use over extended service areas via skywave by a few specially licensed AM broadcasting stations. These channels are called clear channels, and the stations, called clear-channel stations, are required to broadcast at higher powers of 10 to 50 kW. Uses and applications A major use of these frequencies is AM broadcasting; AM radio stations are allocated frequencies in the medium wave broadcast band from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz in Europe; in North America this extends from 525 kHz to 1705 kHz Some countries also allow broadcasting in the 120-meter band from 2300 to 2495 kHz; these frequencies are mostly used in tropical areas.

Rockets are perfectly capable of launching directly into a thunderstorm, just as a civil airliner might do, but there's a wee bit of a problem with doing so. Rockets are made of metal, and their exhaust is partially ionized, so during liftoff the entire rocket+exhaust trail is like a giant conductive wire tying the rocket to the ground. If the rocket flies into a thunderstorm then it will attract lightning strikes. Rockets can be made to withstand such strikes, and most of the current flows over the skin of the vehicle (just as with an airliner) but that adds a lot of difficulty.

When the time was polled, the MET was incorrectly set eleven hours off. As such, once Starliner had reached space, it continued following its preprogrammed commands from the time it had on board. In this instance, it believed it was eleven hours ahead in the mission and in a different orbit. In trying to maintain this precise orbit, Starliner began to use propellant to correct itself. This issue was confounded by the communication error. Once controllers recognized that the craft was rapidly firing thrusters to maintain the orbit it was not in, there was a delay in communications with the craft, resulting in a missed opportunity to react to the issue and reconfigure the craft to attain the needed orbit to dock. The communications error is an interesting case, as part of the blame is being place on Earth-generated background noise.

The new powerful SuperDraco engine, an advancement of the Draco engines currently used by SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to maneuver on orbit and during reentry, will enable astronauts to eject to safety in the event of an emergency during launch. As part of SpaceX's state-of-the-art launch escape system, eight SuperDraco engines built into the side walls of the Dragon spacecraft will produce up to 120,000 pounds of axial thrust to carry astronauts to safety should an emergency occur during launch. The eight SuperDracos provide redundancy, so that even if one engine fails an escape can still be carried out successfully. The engines can also be restarted multiple times if necessary and they will have the ability to deep throttle, providing astronauts with precise control and enormous power, SpaceX said. In addition, as a part of a recoverable Dragon spacecraft, the engines can be used repeatedly, helping to advance SpaceX's long-term goal of making spacecraft more like airplanes, which can be flown again and again with minimal maintenance between flights, it said.

When an object penetrates the atmosphere at the crazy speeds of orbital mechanics, the air is compressed into a shockwave in front of the object and heats up to very high temperature. After colliding with our object, the air in the zone of the shockwave can achieve local temperature of several thousand to several tens of thousands of degrees.

The blackout is a result of the craft being surrounded by a plume of incandescent plasma generated by the heat of re-entry. Such a plasma is impenetrable by radio waves, but can be pierced by x-rays. Using their prototype, Mr Hang and his colleagues are able to encode messages into x-rays, transmit them through a vacuum, and then decode them at the other end. A practical version of this system would not broadcast signals directly to Earth from the re-entering craft. Rather it would transmit them to a satellite that then relayed the message Earthward by more conventional means. The reason for the detour is that, though x-rays penetrate dust, they are absorbed by the sorts of gases that make up Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The re-entry transceiver works because the period of re-entry blackout happens high in the atmosphere, where the air is thin. A signal beamed through the thick air of the lower atmosphere would, by contrast, be absorbed. xcom, as Mr Hang dubs his putative x-ray Aldis lamp, would be a more powerful version of such a spacecraft transmitter. To avoid atmospheric absorption it would have to be put into space to operate. Ideally, it would sit on the far side of the Moon, shielded from interference from Earth.

There was a half-hour period of very poor communications with the Command Module due to the spacecraft being in a poor attitude with the Lunar Module still attached.

When future spacecraft re-enter the atmosphere, a new kind of antenna might help them keep in contact with ground control, despite the fiery sheaths of superhot plasma around them, researchers say. The technology might also help keep communication lines open to other hypersonic vehicles, such as military planes and ballistic missiles. As NASA's Apollo 13 crisis revealed in 1970, this radio silence can be fraught with extraordinary tension. As the crippled spacecraft plummeted back toward Earth, the communications blackout lasted more than a minute longer than expected, leaving ground control in tortured suspense over whether the three astronauts aboard had survived. \"When a re-entry vehicle is unable to be connected, the only thing you can do is pray for it,\" study lead author Xiaotian Gao, a physicist at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China, said in a statement. Prior studies have tried to solve this communication blackout problem, but they all had their shortcomings. For instance, scientists have suggested changing the shape of hypersonic vehicles, because sharp-nosed vehicles have thinner plasma sheaths than blunt-nosed ones. But sometimes, blunt-nosed bodies are preferable because they can withstand heat better and slow down more quickly. Other approaches involve using magnetic fields to control the plasma sheath, or injecting water or other liquids into the plasma sheath to make it more permeable to radio signals, but these methods"}, {"title": "rpj-common-crawl-2020-05", "text": "\u2013 just vanished.

The attenuation increases as the thickness and density of the plasma surrounding the reentry vehicle increases. An illustration of the plasma sheath surrounding a reentry vehicle is given in Figure 1. Regions of lower and higher plasma density near the vehicle are indicated.

In the Plasma Depletion Experimentvi, Challenger astronauts fired the shuttle\u2019s orbital maneuvering subsystem engines as the spacecraft passed over radar and radio observatories, releasing 244 kilograms of carbon dioxide, water, and hydrogen exhaust. The exhaust caused the positive ions and electrons to combine and reform neutral atoms and molecules, creating a depletion in the ionospheric plasma. Decreasing the plasma density means longer-wavelength radio waves can pass through the atmosphere and reach the ground.

Flight test objectives were to measure thrust and to examine electromagnetic compatibility with other spacecraft subsystems. The 5-cm-diameter thrusters were designed to operate at 0.02 kW and provide about 89 mN thrust at about 6700 s specific impulse. Thrusters had the capability to operate at 5 setpoints from 18 mN to 89 mN. Thrusters were configured so they could be used for East-West stationkeeping. Prior to launch, a 5-cm cesium thruster was life tested for 2245 hours at the 67 mN thrust level. During the launch process the Centaur stage did not achieve a second burn, and the spacecraft remained attached to the Centaur in a 218 km by 760 km orbit.

At the same time, the layers affected by the meteoroids on Earth are very narrow, maybe only a mile or two wide, while Venus and Mars both have layers stretching six to eight miles.

The CINDI observations show that the neutral wind creates piles of neutral gas pushed up against ionospheric density variations - similar to how blowing snow piles up in drifts against a building wall.

Such density variations are necessary data to include when modeling interference with radio waves or excess drag on a travelling spacecraft.

Developing the capability to predict such space weather disturbances has been a long-standing goal of the Air Force Research Laboratory.

As a natural plasma, often nonlinear and nonthermal, the ionosphere is a site for active experiments with radiowaves, powerful enough to produce observable ionospheric modi\ufb01cations, in the form of increased temperatures and plasma instabilities, and with chemical releases and particle beam experiments. Such ionospheric plasma physics experiments provide new physical insights, although they often raise more questions than they solve. Problems remain at the upper and lower boundaries; i.e. the interactions with the lower atmosphere and the magnetosphere, and how their e\ufb00ects spread worldwide. Large electric \ufb01elds generated in thunderstorms can a\ufb00ect the ionosphere. There are suggestions of topographic in\ufb02uences, e.g. of mountain ranges, on the ionosphere. The reverse question of ionospheric, geomagnetic and solar e\ufb00ects on weather and climate is contentious; possible relations between magnetic and solar disturbance and the weather have been found, but their physical mechanisms are not well established. The basic mechanisms of the ionosphere seem to be known, but surprises are possible in any active area of science, and many questions remain.

INTRODUCTION Ionospheric sounding has been a standard tool for probing the ionosphere for many years. Principles of the sounding are based on the reflection of the radio waves from the ionized component of Earth's upper atmosphere (Appleton, 1927). Ionospheric sounders operate by transmitting a short pulse at a fixed frequency, and then detecting any echoes that are reflected. These echoes relate to the altitude where the plasma frequency is equal to the wave frequency. By measuring the time delay between the transmission of the pulse and the time that the echo is received, the range to the reflection point can be computed. By sequentially stepping the transmitter frequency after each transmit-receive cycle, the time delay, and hence the range to the reflection point, can be determined as a function of frequency. However, since radio waves return to the groundbased radar from only the portion of the ionosphere below the level of maximum electron density, no information about the ionosphere above this level can be retrieved. To perform topside sounding, ionosondes were fist mounted on rockets (Knecht et al., 1961) and later on satellites [Alouette (Lockwood, 1963), ISIS 1, 2 (McAfee, 1969)]. The situation with topside sounding (satellite-and rocketborne sounders) turned out to be less analogous to bottomside sounding (ground-based radars) than was expected.

The numerical solutions show that, under certain conditions, a spacecraft can take on a negative potential in spite of strong photoelectron currents. The negative potential is due to an electrostatic barrier near the surface of the spacecraft that can reflect a large fraction of the photoelectron flux back to the spacecraft. This electrostatic barrier forms if (1) the photoelectron density at the surface of the spacecraft greatly exceeds the ambient plasma density, (2) the spacecraft size is significantly larger than local Debye length of the photoelectrons, and (3) the thermal electron energy is much larger than the characteristic energy of the escaping photoelectrons. All of these conditions are present near the Sun. The numerical solutions also show that the spacecraft's negative potential can be amplified by an ion wake. The negative potential of the ion wake prevents secondary electrons from escaping the part of spacecraft in contact with the wake.

For the Earth, the ionosphere extends from 80 km above the ground, where neutrals outnumber ions by over 8 orders of magnitude, to around 1000 km, where ions and neutrals have similar numbers.

The first Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft was launched in 1972; the last is scheduled to fly in 2020. Presently, there is no replacement for the space-weather monitoring sensors that now fly on DMSP. The present suite has provided comprehensive, long-term records that constitute a critical component of the US space weather corporate memory. Evolving operational needs and research accomplishments justify continued collection of space environmental data. Examples include measurements to: (1) Monitor the Dst index in real time as a driver of next-generation satellite drag models; (2) Quantify electromagnetic energy fluxes from deep space to the ionosphere/ thermosphere that heat neutrals, drive disturbance-dynamo winds and degrade precise orbit determinations; (3) Determine strengths of stormtime electric fields at high and low latitudes that lead to severe blackouts and spacecraft anomalies; (4) Specify variability of plasma density irregularities, equatorial plasma bubbles, and the Appleton anomaly to improve reliability of communication, navigation and surveillance links; (5) Characterize energetic particle fluxes responsible for auroral clutter and"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "systems.

The former, along with a technique for studying internal energy dependences of ion molecule reactions, led to the AF Basic Research award. Development of a technique to study reactivity at high pressures has been valuable in understanding scramjet engines and produced the only examples of specific energy transfer parameters for ions. A comprehensive study on electron attachment to SF6 resolved numerous issues involving this well studied reaction and determined why the molecule does not quench plasmas at high temperature.

It was proposed that impulses acting on the boundary might lead to a trapping of these waves on the dayside by the ionosphere, resulting in a standing wave or eigenmode of the magnetopause surface. No direct observational evidence of this has been found to date and searches for indirect evidence have proved inconclusive, leading to speculation that this mechanism might not occur. By using fortuitous multipoint spacecraft observations during a rare isolated fast plasma jet impinging on the boundary, here we show that the resulting magnetopause motion and magnetospheric ultra-low frequency waves at well-defined frequencies are in agreement with and can only be explained by the magnetopause surface eigenmode. We therefore show through direct observations that this mechanism, which should impact upon the magnetospheric system globally, does in fact occur. P lanetary magnetic fields act as obstacles to solar/stellar winds with their interaction forming a well-defined region of space known as a magnetosphere. The outer boundary of a magnetosphere, the magnetopause, is arguably the most significant since it controls the flux of mass, energy, and momentum both into and out of the system, with the boundary's motion thus having wide ranging consequences.

Data from the MagEIS suite of sensors measures energy spectra, fluxes, and yields electron deposition rates that can cause internal charging. We use omni-directional fluxes of electrons and protons to calculate the dose under varying materials and thicknesses of shielding (similar to Fennell et al., 2010).

The Low Orbit Pearl Satellite series consists of six constellations, with each constellation consisting of three identical microsatellites that line up just like a string of pearls. The first constellation of three satellites were launched on 29 September 2017, with an inclination of \u223c 35.5\u2218 and \u223c 600 km altitude. Each satellite is equipped with three identical fluxgate magnetometers that measure the in situ magnetic field and its low-frequency fluctuations in the Earth's low-altitude orbit. The triple sensor configuration enables separation of stray field effects generated by the spacecraft from the ambient magnetic field (e.g., Zhang et al., 2006). This paper gives a general description of the magnetometer including the instrument design, calibration before launch, in-flight calibration, in-flight performance, and initial results. Unprecedented spatial coverage resolution of the magnetic field measurements allow for the investigation of the dynamic processes and electric currents of the ionosphere and magnetosphere, especially for the ring current and equatorial electrojet during both quiet geomagnetic conditions and storms.

Scientists want to understand these changes, so they can eventually better predict them and protect our interests in space. Space may look empty, but the ionosphere brims with electrically charged gases, solar radiation, and electric and magnetic fields. Turbulence in this sea of charged particles can manifest as disruptions that interfere with orbiting satellites or communication and navigation signals used, for example, to guide airplanes, ships and self-driving cars.

The refrigerator-size ICON satellite will study the airglow formed from gases in the ionosphere and also measure the charged environment right around the spacecraft which is at a level of 580 kilometers above the Earth\u2019s surface. A NASA satellite launched last year, Gold, is also studying the upper atmosphere, but from much higher up.

The only serious problem was during reentry and splashdown of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic nitrogen tetroxide fumes, caused by the reaction control system (RCS) oxidizer venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and nitrogen tetroxide was sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton.

A capsule is the specified form for the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. A manned space capsule must have everything necessary for everyday life, including air, water and food. The space capsule must also protect astronauts from the cold and radiation of space. A capsule must be well insulated and have a system that controls the inside temperature and environment. It also must have a way that the astronauts would not be knocked around during launch or reentry. Additionally, since the inside will be weightless, there must be a way for the astronauts to stay in their seats during the flight. For this each seat has a system of straps and buckles. One of the most important things that a space capsule must have is a way to communicate with people back on Earth, or mission control.

The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter arrived at Mars in 2016 and deployed the Schiaparelli EDM lander, a test lander that had partial success. Crash-landed on surface, but transmitted data during descent. The following entails a brief overview of Mars exploration, oriented towards orbiters and flybys; see also Mars landing and Mars rover. Mars 1M spacecraft. Between 1960 and 1969, the Soviet Union launched nine probes intended to reach Mars. They all failed: three at launch; three failed to reach near-Earth orbit; one during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory; and two during the interplanetary orbit. The Mars 1M programs (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was the first Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, Mars 1960A and Mars 1960B (also known as Korabl 4 and Korabl 5 respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition, so Earth parking orbit was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120 km before reentry. Mars 1962A was a Mars fly-by mission, launched on October 24, 1962 and Mars 1962B an intended first Mars lander mission, launched in late December of the same year (1962).

Let\u2019s look at these alternatives. Korabi-Sputnik 1 (aka Sputnik 4) was launched by the Soviet Union on 15 May 1960 and was reported to be a test of an orbital spacecraft with a recoverable, pressurized capsule capable of carrying a cosmonaut. At the time of its launch, Sputnik 4 was the largest satellite placed in orbit, with a weight of at least 5 tons. Sputnik 4 appears to have been a prototype of the Soviet Vostok spacecraft that carried the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into orbit on 12 April 1961. Due to a failure in the control or reentry system, the Sputnik 4 capsule did not return to Earth as planned, but instead, remained in orbit until 5 September 1962. On that day, Sputnik 4 reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and broke up, with fragments landing in Lake Michigan and in downtown Manitowoc, WI. The following diagram from the 3 December 1962 issue of Aviation Week magazine shows the paths for Sputnik 4 fragments that landed on the main street of Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

These were mounted in the retrograde section of the adapter module, located just behind the capsule's heat shield.[3][4] Apollo program[edit] For lunar flights, the Apollo command and service module did not require retrorockets to return the command module to Earth, as the flight path took the module through the atmosphere, using atmospheric drag to reduce velocity. The test flights in Earth orbit required retrograde propulsion, which was provided by the large Service Propulsion Engine on the service module. The same engine was used as a retrorocket to slow the spacecraft for lunar orbit insertion. The Apollo Lunar Module used its descent stage engine to drop from orbit and land on the Moon. Retrorockets were used to back the S-IC and S-II stages off from the rest of the vehicle after their respective shutdowns during the Saturn V's launch to Earth parking orbit. Space Shuttle program[edit] The Space Shuttle Orbital maneuvering system provided the vehicle with a pair of powerful liquid-fueled rockets for both reentry and orbital maneuvering. One was sufficient for a successful reentry, and if both systems were to fail, the reaction control system could slow the vehicle enough for reentry. Landers[edit] Retrorockets are also used in landing spacecraft on other astronomical bodies, such as the Moon and Mars, as well as enabling a spacecraft to enter an orbit around such a body, when otherwise it would scoot past and off into space again.

The range safety officer sent a launch holdfire command prior to the start of the terminal countdown sequence, as a test of range safety communications. The countdown resumed, with simulated umbilical ejection, holddown arm release, retraction of the tail service masts and swing arms, and liftoff at 2:17 p.m. on June 6. Electrical power to the vehicle came from ground support equipment rather than the batteries and fuel cells aboard the vehicle. An abbreviated simulated mission followed the liftoff, covering CSM propulsion tests and major operations through command module splashdown. Next, the team performed a backup guidance simulated mission. In this scenario, the guidance systems on the launch vehicle and CSM switched over to backup systems. This was to identify any potential sources of interference between the launch vehicle and spacecraft systems. The launch vehicle portion of a simulated flight included tests of the propellant dispersion (vehicle destruct) command systems.
