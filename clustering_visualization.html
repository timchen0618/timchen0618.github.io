You can prepare yourself by learning basic first aid steps to deal with a burn injury. In this guide, we\u2019ll discuss the classification of burns in children and the correct first aid treatment for a child with burns. Burns are classified and treated according to the degree and extent of tissue damage and the type of agent responsible. Burns to the face, neck, crotch, feet, and joints are generally more serious than other burns. First-degree burns are minor, affecting only the outer layer of skin (epidermis). They may cause pain, reddening and mild swelling, but they do not produce blisters. Second-degree burns involve both the epidermis and underlying dermis layers of skin, resulting in blistering and oozing in addition to pain, reddening, and swelling. Third-degree burns are the most serious, destroying all the layers of skin and damaging underlying tissue, including nerves. In most instances of third-degree burns, there is no pain because the nerves have been destroyed. The burned area may appear white or blackened due to charring, and the underlying muscle or other tissue is exposed. Call for immediate emergency help.

When sealed, they normally provide excellent protection for the underlying skin. However, in some situations a physician may rupture and remove the covering of a blister using a sterile technique, especially if infection is evident.

So here is a look at what you should do for a burn. One of the best things that you can do immediately after becoming burned is to run cool water over the burn site. You will then need to see how bad the burn is. The different degrees of burns, which are determined by the amount of damage, have different types of treatment. The mildest type of burn is a first degree burn. This type of burn only affects the top layer of skin. Start by running cool water over the burned area. The water should not be so cold that it causes the surrounding area to become numb. Once you have cooled the burned area, over the counter pain relievers can be used to help any residual pain and discomfort. Watch the burn site for signs of infection and keep clean until fully healed. The next level of burn injury is a second degree burn.

Just in case you did not know, there are three degrees of burns. It is important for you to know this because it can be the difference between merely keeping them alive and preventing long-term scarring and infection. \u00b7 Second-degree burns, otherwise called partial thickness burns, usually involve both the outer skin layers and the layers underneath. These typically have all the attributes of the first-degree burns and then blistering. This is usually more painful than the first and can result in skin discoloration temporarily or permanently. \u00b7 Third-degree burns, otherwise referred to as full thickness, burns often involve the outer and deeper skin layers. These often result in blackened, disfigured and extensively scarred skin. While most first-degree burns may fall into the category of mild or moderate burns which typically don\u2019t cause much damage, the second and third-degree burns tend to be severe particularly when the significant areas of the body are involved. There are quite a few treatment options when it comes to burn care and treatment. The following should serve as decent guides for you.

Second-Degree Burns affect both the outer and underlying layer of the skin, causing pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. Third-Degree Burns Severe tissue damage is evident involving the skin, fatty tissue, nerves, and other tissues deep below the surface. Indications of third-degree burns include swelling, skin that is charred or white, and limited pain because nerves have been damaged or destroyed. Before giving first aid, consider how extensively burned the victim is and try to determine the depth of the most serious part of the burn. Then treat the entire burn accordingly. Knowing how the burn occurred is helpful, since different sources cause different types of burns. If in doubt, treat it as a severe burn. Giving immediate first aid before professional medical help is received may lessen the severity of the burn. Prompt medical attention to serious burns can help prevent scarring, disability, and deformity. If the burn does not heal normally, get medical advice.

Superficial second-degree burn penetrates the entire epidermal layer of skin and extends down to the next skin layer, known as the dermis. A second-degree burn[2] may appear moist and pinkish in color. A superficial second-degree burn may heal spontaneously, often within two weeks. Full-thickness third-degree burns differ from the superficial second- degree burns because the tissue destruction runs deeper into the dermis. A full-thickness burn will be dry and whitish in color.

The degree of burn that you have may affect the benefits to which you\u2019re entitled under workers\u2019 compensation law. A first-degree burn may cause no impairment, for example, while a third-degree burn may cause lasting impairment that warrants a higher impairment rating. If your burn injuries cause permanent impairment, you may recover permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits. These provide 80 percent of pre-injury wages for a number of weeks depending on the body part that\u2019s affected and the impairment rating issued by a doctor (for scheduled member disabilities). For example, if the burns cause permanent disfigurement on the face or head, then the worker is entitled to a maximum of 150 weeks of PPD benefits. If the impairment rating is 50 percent, then the number of weeks would be 50 percent of 150 weeks, or 75 weeks. In the case of an unscheduled member disability, the impairment rating plays a role in benefits, but many other factors are taken into consideration as well when determining PPD benefits.

By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city. There are four central approaches to the anthropological study of cities. The first is the urban ecology model in which the community and family network are central. The second is based on power and knowledge, specifically of how the city is planned. The third approach is studying local and supralocal and the link between the two degrees of units in the city. The last approach focuses on cities where political economy is central to the city\u2019s infrastructure. Low uses several prominent studies from urban anthropologists to compile a list of the different types of cities that do not fall into only one category, and what factors individualize them.

In reality, however, Clausewitz neither coined nor used the term \"total war,\" and \"absolute (or ideal) war,\" it is argued, is quite a different concept.

Kippax finished second to Bradman in the first-class averages and aggregates, scoring 1451 runs at 58.04. He hit a century in each innings of the match with Sussex. In the Tests, Kippax passed fifty four times in seven innings, without going on to a hundred.

However, Wisden rated his 64 not out on a wet wicket in the first Test at Nottingham as his best effort and summarised his tour thus: Essentially a stylist, Kippax was in every sense a great batsman, for he could suit his game to the needs of the occasion. A beautiful driver to the off, he cut at times in delightful fashion, the slower wickets of England affecting his abilities in that direction in only the slightest degree. In the 1930\u201331 home series against the West Indies, Kippax began with what was to be his highest score in Test cricket (146 in under four hours) in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval.

There are four questions you need to ask yourself to plan this motion. * How much does it change? This is the *amplitude*. * What is the center, or *resting value*, of the change? * How quickly does the cycle repeat? This is the *frequency*. * At what point in the cycle does it start? This is the *phase*. The first two questions are answered with values. If you want a value to change periodically between 0 and 10, then you would choose a resting value of `5`, which is the center of the range. The amplitude would also be `5`, since that's the range of motion away from the center. The second two questions are answered with angles, in degrees. A full cycle is 360 degrees. With this in mind, the frequency is the degrees per second of progress through the cycle. For example, if you want one cycle per second, then you need a frequency of 360 degrees per second. The phase is the starting point. In many cases, you won't care about the phase. Once you have these four values, you'll combine the `sin` function with *two* linear expressions. The frequency and phase form a linear expression in the parameter to `sin`, and the amplitude and resting value make a linear pattern with its result.

The first subject reappears gradually, first hinted at in the inner parts (bars 44-46) then in the treble of bar 54 before rising up from the lower register as a fully fledged countersubject (bars 59-61).Third sectionThe third section is a five-part double fugue for full organ. The preceding bar in the second section is played as three beats of one minim (a hemiola) and thus provides the new pulse. The third subject is lively and dancelike, resembling a gigue, again starting on the second beat of the bar. The characteristic motif of 4 semiquavers in the third beat has already been heard in the countersubject of the first section and in the second subject. The running semiquaver passagework is an accelerated continuation of the quaver passagework of the second section; occasionally it incorporates motifs from the second section. At bar 88, the third subject merges into the first subject in the soprano line,"}, {"title": " ", "text": "Finland differs from most industrialized countries in that many of its energy needs stem from the Nordic conditions. Finland is located between 60 and 70 degrees northern latitude and a quarter of its area lies north of the Arctic Circle. In fact, one third of all people living north of the 60th parallel are Finns. The annual mean temperature in the south of the country is around 5 \u00b0C and 0 \u00b0C in the north. The population-weighted average number of heating degree days for Finland is 5000, considerably more than in Sweden and Norway (4000). Thus, the Finnish climate is the coldest in the EU and, consequently, a large share of the energy (22%) is used for the heating of buildings. Finland's energy consumption increased 44% in electricity and 30% in total energy use during the period 1990\u20132006. The increase in electricity consumption of 15,000 GWh (1995\u20132005) was more than Finland's total hydroelectric power capacity. The consumption increased almost equally in all sectors (industry, residential, and services). The share of renewable electricity in Finland has been stable (1998\u20132005): 11-12% plus yearly variable hydroelectric power, totaling 24-27%. The forest industries contributed 57% of the RE power generation via black liquor and wood burning in 1990. By 2005 this share had grown to 67%. The rest consisting primarily of hydroelectric power. As with most first world countries, the vast majority of commercially viable hydroelectric sites in Finland have already been developed. The forest industry uses 30% of all electricity in Finland (1990\u20132005).

Such a system is reminiscent of Herbert Anton Kellner's 1977 temperament and even more, among the others, the temperament of Arp Schnitger's 1688 Organ of St. Ludgeri in Norden and the temperament later described by Carlo Gervasoni in his La scuola della musica (Piacenza, 1800). Such a system with all its major thirds more or less sharp is confirmed by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg's report about the way a famous student of Bach's, Johann Philipp Kirnberger, was taught to tune in his lessons with Bach. It allows all 24 keys to be played through without changing tuning nor unpleasant intervals, but with varying degrees of difference-the temperament being unequal, and the keys not all sounding the same. Compared to Werckmeister III, the other 24 keys-circulating temperament, Bach's tuning is much more differentiated with its 8 (instead of Werckmeister's 4) different kinds of major thirds.

The first verse refers to Pittsburgh as a \"smoky ol' town\", and the third complains that the speaker does nothing more than \"cough and choke\" because of the steel industry's output. The smoke was an ever-present part of life in Pittsburgh at the time of the song's writing; steel mills on the banks of the city's three rivers made the sky glow red and continually released smoke. Modern environmentalist reviewers of the song believe that the pollution-oriented verses show that the song was written to protest the environmental conditions in which workers were forced to live. The second and fourth verses focus on the labor disputes that the city was experiencing at the time. The second verse uses a pun on the name of Jones and Laughlin Steel to ask what the company stole from its workers (\"What did Jones and Laughlin steal?\"), while the fourth and final verse ends with the statement that all of the mill workers are \"joining up with the CIO.\" Recordings and adaptations The song has been"}, {"title": " ", "text": "digital valve, and the third valve may be a third digital valve.

In this study, we developed a new method for discerning such relationships between two individuals by examining the number of chromosomal shared segments estimated from high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We computationally generated second-degree kinships (i.e., uncle-nephew and grandfather-grandson) and third-degree kinships (i.e., first cousins and great-grandfather-great-grandson) for 174,254 autosomal SNPs considering the effect of linkage disequilibrium and recombination for each SNP. We investigated shared chromosomal segments between two individuals that were estimated based on identity by state regions. We then counted the number of segments in each pair. Based on our results, the number of shared chromosomal segments in collateral relationships was larger than that in lineal relationships with both the second-degree and third-degree kinships. This was probably caused by differences involving chromosomal transitions and recombination between relationships. As we probabilistically evaluated the relationships between simulated pairs based on the number of shared segments using logistic regression, we could determine accurate relationships in >90% of second-degree relatives and >70% of third-degree relatives, using a probability criterion for the relationship \u22650.9.

There are six main stages that sintering processes can be grouped in which may overlap with one another: 1 initial bonding among particles, 2) neck growth, 3) pore channel closure, 4) pore rounding, 5) densification or pore shrinkage, and 6) pore coarsening. The main mechanisms present in these stages are evaporation, condensation, grain boundaries, volume diffusion, and plastic deformation. Most sintering furnaces contain three zones with three different properties that help to carry out the six steps above. The first zone, commonly coined the burn-off or purge stage, is designed to combust air, burn any contaminants such as lubricant or binders, and slowly raise the temperature of the compact materials. If the temperature of the compact parts is raised too quickly, the air in the pores will be at a very high internal pressure which could lead to expansion or fracture of the part. The second zone, known as the high-temperature stage, is used to produce solid-state diffusion and particle bonding. The material is seeking to lower its surface energy and does so by moving toward the points of contact between particles. The contact points become larger and eventually a solid mass with small pores is created. The third zone, also called the cooling period, is used to cool down the parts while still in a controlled atmosphere. This is an important zone as it prevents oxidation from immediate contact with the air or a phenomenon known as rapid cooling.

Technical drawings Types The two types of technical drawings are based on graphical projection. This is used to create an image of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface. Two-dimensional representation Two-dimensional representation uses orthographic projection to create an image where only two of the three dimensions of the object are seen. Three-dimensional representation In a three-dimensional representation, also referred to as a pictorial, all three dimensions of an object are visible. Views Multiview Multiview is a type of orthographic projection. There are two conventions for using multiview, first-angle and third-angle. In both cases, the front or main side of the object is the same. First-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they land. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90 degrees to the right. What is seen will be drawn to the right of the front side. Third-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they are. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90 degrees to the right. What is seen is actually the left side of the object and will be drawn to the left of the front side.

One of the most notable differences between the Martlet 4 and the GLO-1B was the elimination of the Attitude Control Module between the second and third stages. A dedicated Attitude Control Module was eliminated by modifying the flight profile of the GLO-1B vehicle. The Martlet 4 vehicle used the Attitude Control Module to insure the pitch and yaw of the vehicle was within set parameters prior to the ignition of the second and third stages. With the GLO-1B this was simplified by modifying the mission sequence which made it necessary to provide attitude control for the third stage only. The first stage of the GLO-1B was unguided and, in the same manner as the Martlet 4, relied on both spin stabilization and the fixed geometry of the barrel to insure a predictable flight path prior to first stage ignition. The Martlet 4 flight profile specified a delay between the first stage burnout and second stage ignition during which the Attitude Control Module was activated to insure the vehicles orientation was correct prior to the second stage burn.

Daily deaths also dropped, going down to 203 that day and going back to levels reached one or two months prior. On 10 September, Health Minister Fernando Ruiz made an analysis of the situation of the pandemic in the country six months after its onset. According to Ruiz, the pandemic had developed in the country in a similar way to that of the rest of the world, and identified four moments according to the degree of affectation of the different cities of the country. A first moment, with a very quick, high and severe impact was experienced in Leticia, with affectation in said city being more similar to the situation in Brazil, and later a second moment in coastal cities such as Barranquilla, Cartagena, Buenaventura and Tumaco, as well as Quibd\u00f3. The third wave, which was being experienced at the moment, involved peaks in the main cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, and Cali, while a fourth wave was being expected in middle cities such as Bucaramanga, C\u00facuta, Popay\u00e1n, Pasto and others with a slower growth of cases such as Manizales in which positive cases were already starting to spike.

But if you just got a little color, iow nothing a doctor would call even a first degree burn, it would be even more ridiculous. We use words to deliniate things.

As with first-degree burns, seconddegree burns will heal on their own with appropriate care, leaving little scarring. Since both the epidermis and dermis are injured in a second-degree burn, it is known as a deep partialthickness or partial-thickness burn. Third-degree burns damage all layers of the skin and in severe cases can injure underlying structures such as muscle and bone. Burns of this type leave charred, blackened, and/or dry, pearly white areas (photos 77 and ). The patient may suffer severe pain. However, this pain is probably the result of nearby second-degree burns, as the nerve endings are often destroyed in third-degree burns. Third-degree burns heal poorly since the regenerative powers of the tissues have been lost. If left to its own resources, the burn usually will scar over from the edges where viable tissue still exists. Skin grafting is required to bring about proper healing of the burn. Thirddegree burns are also defined as full-thickness burns, as they extend throughout all dermal layers and possibly to the subcutaneous layers, muscle, and bone. Photos 77 and 78: Third-degree burns to the foot and arm. Note the blackened and pearly white areas.

These burns are very painful. Repair is complete without scar formation. 2. Dermo-epidermal (Third and Fourth degree Dupuytren): Whole thickness of skin is destroyed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue is affected. In Dermo-epidermal, pain and shock are greater than in first degrees burns (most painful). 3.

The most common type of burn injury, a thermal burn injury, occurs as a result of residential fires, automobile accidents, matches, gasoline, heaters or electrical malfunctions. Injuries from fire or hot objects include: flame burns, deep burns that penetrate thick areas of skin and muscle; hot liquid burns, deep burns caused by liquids such as coffee, hot grease, soup or hot water; and flash injuries, which are burns to exposed skin that are usually caused by explosions. Burn injuries are classified as first-, second- or third-degree burns. First-degree burn injuries affect the outer layer of skin, or epidermis. These are superficial burns that usually cause redness, swelling and pain. Sunburn is an example of a first-degree burn; while painful, it will usually heal on its own and not cause permanent damage. Second-degree burns are serious injuries that cause damage to several layers of the skin, going beyond the epidermis to the layer below, which is called the dermis.

There are two types of burns from fires: flash burns and burns from flames. Flash burns result from a sudden intense heat, which usually result from some form of explosion. Generally, people who have sustained flash burns can be treated as an outpatient and do not require extensive medical care. On the other hand, those who suffer burns from flames may incur extensive damage depending on the severity of the burn. There are four widely accepted burn types, which are separated by degrees. First-degree burns affect only the top layer of skin, which is known as the epidermis. In these burn types the skin is usually red and painful, however, this burn is usually equivalent to a sunburn and the healing process normally does not take longer than 3-5 days. Second-degree burns can be classified as either partial or full thickness burns and are more severe than first degree burns.

Burns that damage muscles underneath the subcutaneous skin layer are described as full thickness burns with injury to the underlying muscle (sometimes formerly called fourth degree burns). Superficial burns normally heal within 5 to 7 days. A common type of superficial burn is a sunburn. Because the top layer of skin (the epidermis) is thin (about the thickness of a piece of paper), it is easily replaced. Even when skin is not injured, the skin completely replaces the epidermis every 45 to 75 days. Healing from a superficial burn usually occurs without scarring, although there may be some permanent discoloration. The dermis is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis. As a result, the seriousness of a partial thickness (or dermal) burn depends on how much of the dermis has been injured. A deep and large partial thickness burn will usually be treated with skin grafting. Partial thickness burns usually leave scars. A full thickness burn destroys tissue in all three layers of skin, resulting in the loss of not only the skin but also the hair follicles, sweat glands, and the region where new skin cells are formed. For these reasons, full thickness burns require skin grafts. Fourth degree burns extend through the skin into underlying tissues - ligaments and muscle. These are often life-threatening.

Most burns only affect the uppermost layers of skin, but depending on the depth of the burn, underlying tissues can also be affected. Traditionally, burns are characterized by degree, with first degree being least severe and third degree being most. However, a more precise classification system referring to the thickness or depth of the wound is now more commonly used. For the sake of this article, burns will be described by thickness. For a comparison of the two classification systems, see the table below. When the epidermis and dermis are both destroyed and the burn extends down into the subcutaneous tissue, including fat, muscles and even bones, this is referred to as a full-thickness burn (third- and fourth degree burn). For full-thickness burns, generally the skin will either be white, black, brown, charred, or leathery in appearance. Often eschar (dry, black necrotic tissue) will form around the wound. Since nerve endings are destroyed along with the dermis, these wounds are typically painless. However, most full-thickness wounds are surrounded by wounds of various thicknesses, so these areas may still be painful. Infection: One of the main functions of the skin is to act as a barrier against outside infection. However, this physical barrier is broken with partial or full thickness wounds.

A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance. A zone of ischemia is present between the dead superficial tissue and the deeper living tissue. This marginally viable tissue can be readily converted to nonviable tissue by infection or a further decrease in blood flow.

Physicians now generally speak of _superficial_ , _partial_ _thickness_ , and _full_ _thickness_ burns, although you will still hear the earlier terms frequently. The newer classification makes sense because it describes the skin injury: just the top (superficial), into the dermal layer (partial thickness), or entirely through the skin (full thickness). How we manage burns depends on the severity of the burn and its location. Burns such as the one in this scenario are typically of mixed type. For example, they may be superficial in some places and partial thickness in others.

This causes the muscles in the leg to contract and pull the toe away from the source of injury (6). At the same time, the dorsal horn sends another impulse up the spinal cord to the brain. During this trip, the impulse travels between nerve cells. When the impulse reaches a nerve ending (7), the nerve releases chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which carry the message to the adjacent nerve. When the impulse reaches the brain (8), it is analyzed and processed as an unpleasant physical and emotional sensation. Types of burns The Ayat under discussion mentions the burning of the skin. The severity of a burn depends on its depth, its extent, and the age of the victim. Burns are classified by depth as first, second, and third degree. First-degree burns cause redness and pain (e.g., sunburn). Second-degree burns are marked by blisters (e.g., scald by hot liquid). In third-degree burns, both the epidermis and dermis (external and internal parts of the skin) are destroyed, and underlying tissue may also be damaged.

Clinically there is no distinction between the two, and their classification and treatment are identical. In Dupuytren's classification, now most generally accepted, burns are divided into six classes according to the severest part of the lesion. Burns of the first degree are characterized by severe pain, redness of the skin, a certain amount of swelling that soon passes, and later exfoliation of the skin. Burns of the second degree show vesicles (small blisters) scattered over the inflamed area, and containing a clear, yellowish fluid. Beneath the vesicle the highly sensitive papillae of the skin are exposed. Burns of this degree leave no scar, but often produce a permanent discoloration. In burns of the third degree, there is a partial destruction of the true skin, leaving sloughs of a yellowish or black colour. The pain is at first intense, but passes off on about the second day to return again at the end of a week, when the sloughs separate, exposing the sensitive nerve filaments of the underlying skin. This results in a slightly depressed cicatrix, which happily, however, shows but slight tendency to contraction.

Third-degree burn victims would eventually, however, far surpass their less-seriously burned friends in lifetime scarring and disability. Because different areas of the skin conduct heat differently, location of the body areas exposed to heat may determine whether full-thickness burns result.

Aftermath of a Burn Injury The physical and emotional aftermath of a burn takes a toll on victims and their families. In addition to pain and discomfort burn victims also sometimes cope with the following: Permanent scarring. Severe burns leave permanent scars and disfigurement that can be humiliating for burn victims depending on their location. Infection.

Here is how burns are categorized: First degree burns, also known as superficial burns, affect the outer layer of skin called the epidermis. Mild sunburn, which includes painful reddened skin, is a common type of 1st-degree burn. It usually does not cause long-term tissue damage. Second-degree burns, which are also referred to as partial-thickness burns, cause damage to the epidermis as well as part of the underlying layer of tissue known as the dermis. The site of the burn is red, blistered, and swollen. Deep second degree burns can cause scarring. Third-degree burns, also called full-thickness burns, involve damage to the skin and underlying tissue. The site of the burn may appear charred or waxy. A person who has suffered third-degree burns may have difficulty breathing. Treatment of full-thickness burns may require skin grafts because the layer of skin is destroyed. They may be permanently scarred or disfigured and require cosmetic surgery to repair scar damage and damage to joints affecting by scarring.

The practice of classifying burns in \u2018degrees\u2019 was introduced in the 18th century. Two German surgeons, Heister (1724) and Richter (1788) classified burns into four degrees: First degree: Heat, pain and small blisters. Second degree: Severe pain and large blisters. Third degree: Damage to the skin and underlying flesh, with crust formation. Fourth degree: Damage to all soft tissues down to the bone. In 19th century, Guillaume Dupuytren developed a classification of burn depth after a review of the care of 50 patients. This classification divided burns into the following six degrees: First degree: Erythema. Second degree: Skin inflammation with epidermal detachment. Third degree: Partial destruction of the papillary layer and subpapillary network of the corium. Fourth degree: Destruction of the skin down to the subcuticular layer. Fifth degree: Crust formation over skin and muscle. Dupuytren\u2019s classification is still in use by some today.[39] However many modern writings tend to use a simpler three degree classification system and this may be attributed to a French surgeon, Boyer, and was introduced in the beginning of the 18th century (1814).[40] This classification divided burns into the following three degrees: Second degree: Blistering of the skin leading to superficial ulceration. Third degree: Tissue disorganization leading to a dry yellow crust. The current convention for describing burns is using depth rather than degrees; that is superficial, mixed depth and full thickness and new techniques are now in development to help physicians determine the depth of burns more accurately and objectively.

Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, causing numbness. A person with this type of burn may also have difficulty breathing or experience smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide poisoning. Third-degree burns usually require skin grafts for wound closure. Fourth-Degree Burns: Fourth-degree burns destroy all skin layers and extend into muscle, tendon, or bone 5). The skin\u2019s three anatomic layers (i.e., epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue) have functions that are lost after burn injuries. The epidermis is a barrier to bacteria and moisture loss. After a burn injury, local wound care and fluid management are required. The dermis provides elasticity and protection from mechanical trauma, and it contains blood vessels that supply all skin layers. When the skin is damaged, epidermal cells regenerate from cells deep within the dermal appendages, which is why deep dermal injury causes significant scarring and permanent skin damage 6).

A superficial second-degree burn involves heat injury to the upper third of the dermis. The microvessels perfusing this area are injured, and permeability is increased, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of plasma into the interstitium. This fluid lifts off the thin, heat-destroyed epidermis, causing blister formation. Despite loss of the entire basal layer of the epidermis, a burn of this depth will heal in 7 to 14 days. A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance.

You may be most familiar with the traditional burn classification of first, second, and third-degree burns. First-degree burns are usually mild. They affect only the outer layer of skin (epidermis). The skin is likely to be red, and there may be some pain and swelling. Most sunburns are first-degree burns. Second-degree burns injure the second layer (dermis) of skin. The skin will be intensely red and may develop blisters. These burns are often very painful. Third-degree burns involve all the layers of skin. Fat, nerves, muscles, and even bone may be burned.

They can damage epidermis, dermis, blood vessels, tendons, muscles, and bones with varying degrees of pain depending on amount of nerve damage. First Degree Burns \u2013 These burns are superficial, like a mild sunburn, affecting the outer layer of skin. The epidermis gets red, may be painful for a few days, the skin may even peel. There is no blistering. Second Degree Burns \u2013 These burns go down through most, if not all, of the layers of the epidermis. It will potentially reach the topmost layer of dermis. Fluid will accumulate between the epidermis and the dermis, forming blisters. These burns can be nasty, with an increased potential for infection. Third Degree Burns \u2013 These burns go so deep that they destroy all of the tissue through the dermis, reaching into the fatty tissue layer. In some cases, tendons, muscles, and ligaments are compromised. (When the burn reaches muscle and bone, some people refer to it as a 4th degree burn.)

They are more severe than first or second degree burns and always require skin grafts. Third degree burns are a serious injury requiring immediate medical help. Unlike less severe burns, which can be very painful, full-thickness burns may not hurt. This is because the burn may damage nerve endings in the skin responsible for sensing pain. In addition, the burn site may appear waxy or leathery A person with a third degree burn will require hospitalization. Treatment will vary depending on the extent, severity, and location of the burn. If an individual suspects they have a third degree burn, they should seek immediate medical attention. Without treatment, these burns and resulting complications can be fatal. In this article, learn more about third degree burns, including the symptoms, treatment, and when to speak with a doctor. Third degree burns are a severe type of burn that extends through every layer of skin. This type of burn can destroy: the epidermis, the outer layer of skin the dermis, the layer beneath the epidermis the hypodermis in some cases, which is the subcutaneous tissue and the innermost layer of skin Doctors categorize burns according to the damage they cause to the skin and surrounding tissue.

However, they rarely result in complications that require serious medical attention and only require basic first aid. Signs of a first-degree burn include swelling and red coloration. Second-degree burns extend past the first layer of skin. These burns commonly cause blistering. This is the body\u2019s attempt to heal the injury and protect the lower layers of skins. Care for these burns does not always require professional medical care. However, if the burn is large enough, a trip to the hospital may be necessary. Third-degree burns are severe medical emergencies and require intensive treatment to heal. Third-degree burns cause damage to every layer of the skin and damage nerve ending and tissues underneath the skin. This serious injury makes the skin stiff and hard with dark or white coloration. Fourth-degree burns are similar to third-degree burns, but they represent an even more dangerous level of injury. With this type of burn, the damage may extend past the skin and into the muscles and bone. This burn may cause so much damage that healing is not a possibility. Fourth-degree burns often require amputation. Even if a victim fully recovers, the damaged skin usually does not heal back to its original appearance.

While some kinds of burns may need minor medical intervention, palliative care, emergency surgery or a combination of all; deep seated burns can result in life-threatening complications. Such burns affecting a major part of the body may need immediate medical intervention. People may also require medical care at specialized burn centers and prolonged medical treatments of various kinds. These include not only healing the burnt body parts but also, at times, reconstruction of minor organs or even plastic surgery. Burns are classified in three degrees. A first-degree burn is usually a minor burn affecting only the outer layer of skin and normally causes redness and pain. The second-degree burn affects epidermis and dermis, the first two layers of skin and may develop in swelling, blisters and at times scarring. A third-degree burn reaches the fat beneath the skin and may look brown, black or white. It is likely to destroy nerves and cause numbing. So what causes burns and how can we prevent them?

When the impulse reaches a nerve ending (7), the nerve releases chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which carry the message to the adjacent nerve. When the impulse reaches the brain (8), it is analyzed and processed as an unpleasant physical and emotional sensation. Types of burns The Ayat under discussion mentions the burning of the skin. The severity of a burn depends on its depth, its extent, and the age of the victim. Burns are classified by depth as first, second, and third degree. First-degree burns cause redness and pain (e.g., sunburn). Second-degree burns are marked by blisters (e.g., scald by hot liquid). In third-degree burns, both the epidermis and dermis (external and internal parts of the skin) are destroyed, and underlying tissue may also be damaged.

Sweat glands and the roots of hair follicles are in the deeper layers and will be destroyed with a deep burn. Deep injuries heal more slowly, are more difficult to treat, and are more likely to have complications than superficial injuries. The names given to burn injuries of various depths have changed in recent decades.

Third-degree burn victims would eventually, however, far surpass their less-seriously burned friends in lifetime scarring and disability. Because different areas of the skin conduct heat differently, location of the body areas exposed to heat may determine whether full-thickness burns result. The outermost layer of epidermis is an excellent insulator from heat; therefore, where it is thickest, as on the soles and palms, full-thickness burns are rare. Backs of hands, by contrast, are much more susceptible to irreversible burn injury requiring skin grafts.

Second degree burns \u2013 Second degree burns cause damage to both the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the lower layer (dermis). Second-degree burns usually result in swelling and blistering, as well as redness at the site and pain. Third degree burns \u2013 These burns involve extensive damage to both the outer and lower layer of skin, as well as damage to the underlying tissue and bone. Third degree burns often result in white or blackened skin and severe pain. Fourth degree burns \u2013 Fourth degree burns are the most severe type of burn and are usually fatal. They extend through the skin and into muscle and bone. The amount of the body which ends up being burned also dictates the severity and how doctors will go about treatment.

This type of classification, which has been used with only minor alterations for nearly two hundred years, is concerned chiefly with the intensity of burning and not with the depth of tissue destroyed. Only recently have burn physicians come to realize that the depth of injury is of greater importance than superficial appearance. The classification of burns that has recently been adopted has completely forsaken all reference to outward appearances, which are only an indication of the severity of surface burning. The new type of classification recognizes two degrees of burn injury. The first new classification is partial thickness skin loss, implying the presence of sufficient living epithelial elements to resurface the area. The second new classification is full-thickness skin loss, implying virtually complete destruction of all epithelial elements so that healing can only occur by contraction of the wound and epithelial cell migration from the edge of the wound or by surgical intervention. Proper treatment depends on the correct classification of the burn. Further, early differentiation between these two degrees of burns is critical for several reasons. It is better to excise dead tissue and close the wound than to allow spontaneous separation of the slough, with its attendant risks of infection, fibrosis, and loss of function.

Third-Degree Burns Third-degree burns involve the entire epidermis, dermis, and a portion of the subcutaneous region.

In contrast, a contact burn is caused by dry heat, resulting from brief or prolonged direct contact with extremely hot solid objects like irons, stoves, or electrical fixtures. They cause deep dermal or full-thickness burns with the outline corresponding to the shape of the hot object. The lesion appears blackened, is minimally painful, and frequently requires surgical intervention. Q. How are scald injuries classified in children, on the basis of body surface area and depth? The severity of scalds is assessed on the basis of depth (or layers of skin involved) and size, or the percentage of TBSA affected. Wilson's classification as first-, second-, and third-degree or superficial, partial thickness or full-thickness burns is similar in children and adults. However, in newborns and children, the commonly used \u201cRule of nine\u201d to determine the extent of TBSA affected is not applicable due to different body proportions (i.e. larger heads and smaller limbs). The Lund and Browder chart takes the age-dependent variation in surface area of different parts of the body into account [Figure 2].

Second degree burns are visually indicated by withering of the skin without charring. Third degree burns are visually indicated by eschar formation and charring. This type of classification, which has been used with only minor alterations for nearly two hundred years, is concerned chiefly with the intensity of burning and not with the depth of tissue destroyed. Only recently have burn physicians come to realize that the depth of injury is of greater importance than superficial appearance. The classification of burns that has recently been adopted has completely forsaken all reference to outward appearances, which are only an indication of the severity of surface burning. The new type of classification recognizes two degrees of burn injury. The first new classification is partial thickness skin loss, implying the presence of sufficient living epithelial elements to resurface the area. The second new classification is full-thickness skin loss, implying virtually complete destruction of all epithelial elements so that healing can only occur by contraction of the wound and epithelial cell migration from the edge of the wound or by surgical intervention. Proper treatment depends on the correct classification of the burn. Further, early differentiation between these two degrees of burns is critical for several reasons.

The microcirculation in the zone of stasis is characterized by the formation of progressive microthrombus. The location of the zone of stasis varies according to the depth of the burns.

Burn severity is divided by the percentage of total body surface area burned, depth, location and patient age [3]. Burns are commonly classified as first-degree and superficial second-degree burns when only the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged [1,4,5]. For wound healing, rapid healing occurs in 1 to 2 weeks, and scar formation is uncommon in these cases [3]. However, it takes much longer for severe burns, such as deep second-degree and third-degree burns, to heal, and these patients are more susceptible to infections, organ dysfunction and hypertrophic scarring [1]. Severe thermal burns can cause devastating consequences, both functionally and cosmetically [4], and can involve damage to muscles, bones, vasculature and dermal and epidermal tissues, as well as extreme pain due to nerve injuries [5]. The pathophysiological cascades caused by the increased capillary permeability, vascular resistance and changed platelet aggregation after burns may increase the risk of death and burn shock [1,5].

This type of classification, which has been used with only minor alterations for nearly two hundred years, is concerned chiefly with the intensity of burning and not with the depth of tissue destroyed. Only recently have burn physicians come to realize that the depth of injury is of greater importance than superficial appearance. The classification of burns that has recently been adopted has completely forsaken all reference to outward appearances, which are only an indication of the severity of surface burning. The new type of classification recognizes two degrees of burn injury. The first new classification is partial thickness skin loss, implying the presence of sufficient living epithelial elements to resurface the area. The second new classification is full-thickness skin loss, implying virtually complete destruction of all epithelial elements so that healing can only occur by contraction of the wound and epithelial cell migration from the edge of the wound or by surgical intervention. Proper treatment depends on the correct classification of the burn. Further, early differentiation between these two degrees of burns is critical for several reasons.

Grade IIa burns are second degree and noncircumferential and are described as submucosal lesions and ulcerations. Grade IIb burns are second degree but are circumferential.

Broad-spectrum antibiotic such as piperacillin/tazobactam (40.57%) was the most common empirically prescribed antibiotic. In 35 patients (34.3%), there was a change in antibiotic after culture findings. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that 40% of antibiotic therapy decisions followed the recommended clinical guidelines. This study also found that Gram-negative microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were ubiquitous in our burn unit. The study results will facilitate to develop antibiogram for our study setting, thus reducing antibiotic resistance. Further studies are needed to explore the extent and consequences of irrational antibiotic prescriptions in critically ill burn patients.

But the facts of the case tell a very different story. The coffee that burned Stella Liebeck was dangerously hot\u2014hot enough to cause third-degree burns, even through clothes, in three seconds. Liebeck endured third-degree burns over 16 percent of her body, including her inner thighs and genitals\u2014the skin was burned away to the layers of muscle and fatty tissue. She had to be hospitalized for eight days, and she required skin grafts and other treatment. Her recovery lasted two years. Liebeck offered to settle the case for $20,000, but the company refused. McDonald\u2019s offered Liebeck only $800\u2014which did not even cover her medical expenses. When the case went to trial, the jurors saw graphic photos of Liebeck\u2019s burns. They heard experts testify about how hot coffee should be and that McDonald\u2019s coffee was 30 to 40 degrees hotter than coffee served by other companies. The jury learned that 700 other people\u2014including children\u2014had been burned before, yet the company did not change its policy of keeping coffee at between 180 and 190 degrees.

Second degree burns can be a painful process to go through. These types of burns usually are blistered and can look extremely red.

Immediately the skin sheds, the signs, and symptoms go out. This type of burn heals in the space of 7-10 days, without leaving any scar. In this type of burn, the damage done doesn\u2019t just happen at the skin\u2019s surface, it goes beyond the surface, the top layer. And, that\u2019s why it\u2019s more serious than that of the First-Degree. The Second-Degree burn makes the skin to blister and ends up being sore and red. A few of these blisters pop open, making the burn to have an appearance that\u2019s wet. There\u2019s a tissue known as fibrinous exudate \u2014 as time goes on, this particular tissue will, probably, begin to take its place around, over the wound. The nature of this wound appears so delicate, so it\u2019s essential that you ensure that you keep the area, which you have the burn, clean. And also, bandage it in a proper manner \u2014 doing these helps you to stay away from infection. This also does well in helping the burn heal fastly.

However, from the perspective of a real-world scenario, skyscrapers unfortunately tend to cast long shadows on the neighboring areas and sidewalks \u2013 much to the inconvenience of people using those spaces. But as always, there is science that can account for a solution. To that end, architects at the London-based firm NBBJ have come up with the notion of what can be termed as shadow-less buildings. This ingeniously contrived scope entails a pair of buildings that would reflect much of the incoming sunlight onto the adjacent spaces (areas where the shadows would have been cast). Of course, beyond just a concept, such an idea needs some details and complexity \u2013 so as to maintain the sunlight reflection mode during most time of the day. For this, the architects utilized a computer software known as Rhinoceros for the 3D modelling of the consequent buildings. This resulted in the rendering of one of the buildings designed like a gargantuan, curved mirror. This building would reflect the light onto the shadow formed by its southern counterpart \u2013 and, the specific curve of its glass surface would maintain the alignment of reflection all throughout the day. In other words, it is all about following the sun path and offering diffused reflection; as opposed to magnifying the sun-ray that can potentially cause harm to pedestrians using the building sidewalks.

(Of course, for a vertical window, the top reveal surfaces will never be illuminated by beam solar if the reveal surfaces are perpendicular to the glazing, as is being assumed. For each shadow pattern in Figure 99, equations are given for the shadowed areas $${A_{1,sh}}$$ and $${A_{2,sh}}$$ of the outside and inside reveal surfaces, respectively.

But it happens quite frequently with inclined or open windows, like those found in modern buildings.\" Sometimes the reflections take the shape of an X, depending on the curvature of the window creating the reflection. \"The whole effect is due to gravity and heat,\" explains Bagnasco. \"The glass plate slightly curves in the sun, a couple of millimeters are enough, and it becomes a concave mirror, creating a spherical reflection. However, sometimes it can produce a cross or a double cross, according to how the plates are held by the frames, either with four or six hinges.\" A member of CICAP in Turin, Stefano Bardelli, was even able to find just the perfect conditions, demonstrating very clearly how the phenomenon is created (see photographs).

Nobody is surprised at seeing such reflections when walking down the street, because one immediately realizes that they are produced by windows reflecting sunlight. It is only when dozens of pictures of such reflections appear on the World Wide Web, coming from different parts of the world\u2014and newspapers pick up on it\u2014that the \"marvel effect\" strikes.

Researchers accept that very soon, direct examinations of the BHs could be possible \\cite{Cash,Doeleman,Falcke,Bambi}. Henceforth, studying a BH's shadow will be a fruitful way for a better understanding of astrophysical BHs, as well as for the comparison of general relativity to those of modern theories \\cite{Eiroa}. To have information on BHs, the approaches of null geodesics and gravitational lensing are of compelling interest \\cite{Ovgun1,Shahzadi,Khan}.

It should able to image the black hole with resolution at the level of the event horizon. At galactic center the black hole candidate Sgr A$^*$, due to the gravitational lensing effect casts a shadow; the shape and size of this shadow can be calculated. There is a widespread belief that evidence for the existence of black holes will come from the direct observation of its shadow. The shape of a shadow could be used to study extreme gravity near the event horizon and also to know whether the general relativity is consistent with the observations. Observation of a black hole shadow may allow us to determine the mass and spin of a rotating black hole \\cite{Vries, Takahashi04, Takahashi041,Bambi:2008jg,Bambi:2010hf,Goddi:2016jrs}.

That universe is now coming to be better understood. You will see how this has happened and how the shadows in the unknown slowly continue to be lit and identified.

In the sunlight, trees draw intricate shadow patterns on the carpet of flowers that extends far into the distance. I went there early in the morning, about a week ago. At first, some high-altitude clouds were covering the rising sun. There was a diffuse light that created almost no contrast. Then, the sun pierced through and everything changed. Things moved into focus as if you\u2019d put the right pair of glasses on.

Just being there, noticing how the light changes, how the smell of the forest changes. There is nothing else to be done, nowhere else I need to be. Just breathing here with the trees.

At times, the sun, the earth and the moon come to lie in a straight line. The object in between casts a shadow and causes an eclipse. There are two kinds of eclipses, the lunar and solar eclipse. Lunar Eclipse The lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are in a straight line, with the earth in between the sun and the moon. The shadow of the earth is cast on the moon. If the moon is in the umbra cone of the earth, it will not be visible because the moon is non\u2013luminous and since it does not receive any light from the sun, it does not reflect any light. This is called a total lunar eclipse. If the moon is slightly out of line, it will not be completely in the umbra cone of the earth. It then receives some light from the sun which it reflects to the earth and makes itself partially visible. This is called a partial lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipse can occur only on a full moon day.

Just think about all the images at the New York Central station where the sun is just merely entering the station through the windows. You can capture images like during the morning or evening when sun is at a lower angle again. For added effect, smoke works wonders with the light rays just passing in. Stations where you are allowed to vape an e-cigarette would be my favorite choice. So far, the sun was mostly the highlight of the scene itself. Creating a scene of high contrast needs the support of the sun as well, but is more built around the shadows and darker areas. Much like the normal shadow pictures, this time we can search for high buildings that are able to cast a massive shadow and leave only little light left to illuminate the scene. Another place where you can capture photos of high contrast is under bridges. Here you need to face the tunnel while the sun is diagonally behind your back. Search for the edges where the shadow begins to start and photograph the people as they are exiting the dark tunnel. Images like these almost look like you have used a flash, but instead, you utilized the natural contrast to create negative space in your photography.

During totality, the Moon becomes reddish in color due to the light from the Sun filtering through the atmosphere before reaching the Moon. Obviously, this wouldn\u2019t work in the fantasy land that is Flat Earth. The Sun and the Moon float above the pizza-thin planet so there is no possibility that eclipses could be caused by the alignment of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. The cause of the eclipse is (cue dramatic music and flickering candles): the Shadow Object! The Shadow Object is a satellite of the Sun that orbits too close to our star to be seen but can get in between the Earth and the Moon roughly twice a year. I\u2019ve got to say this is some 'galaxy brain'-level thinking. What if we actually had an object made of shadows that only mattered when we needed it to? I really want to believe that all flat-Earthers are part of a performance art piece because the Shadow Object is truly a masterpiece. According to a post by the Flat Earth Society, the Shadow Object is orbiting the Sun at an angle of 5\u00b010\u2019. If you\u2019re wondering where that number comes from, that\u2019s the angle between the orbital plane of the Earth and the orbital plane of the Moon.

It's with some trepidation that I'm starting this section of my blog, because I really don't understand physics very well. Most of it, I suspect, will be about how little I understand. But I'm going to give it a whirl. Sometime this summer it occurred to me that the phenomenon of transparency is more more complex than one might initially think, and more so than most people realize. I went around asking people with more physics education than I had if they could explain to me why things like glass and water are transparent, and it seemed to me that not only did they not understand it any better than I did, but they didn't realize that they didn't understand it. A common response, for example, was that media like glass and water are transparent because the light passes through them unimpeded. This is clearly wrong. We can see that it's wrong because both glass and water have a tendency to refract incident light. Unimpeded photons always travel in straight lines. If light is refracted by a medium, it is because the photons couple with electrons in the medium, are absorbed, and then new photons are emitted"}, {"title": " ", "text": "direction.

If seen from the outer side, we can see through thinking it is transparent, while if seen from the inside, the glass acts as a mirror. How? A: A one way mirror isn't really a one way mirror. It lets the same amount of light through in both directions. It works because one side of the mirror is light while the other is dark. Suppose you're on the light side looking at the mirror, and suppose that the light side is 99 times as bright as the dark side. Finally assume the mirror lets through half the light and reflects half the light. The light from the dark side hits the mirror and half gets through, so the (relative) intensity passing through the mirror is 0.5%. The light around you (in the bright room) hits the mirror and half of it reflects back, so the (relative) intensity of your reflection is 49.5% or 99 times greater than the light from the dark room. Since the human eye isn't good at dealing with large contrasts, your reflection completely swamps the light from the dark side and you can't see through the mirror - all you can see is your own reflection. If you're looking at the mirror from the dark side excatly the opposite argument applies.

But the second, third and fourth miracle are even better. Ewald proves for random media like glass (and Oseen does the same for ordered media such as crystals), that the net result of all of those zillions of little excited light waves add up to zero in every direction but three. Only three big waves survive the fierce destructive interference between zillions of little waves. The first surviving wave travels in the same direction as the incident wave but vibrates exactly 180 degrees out of phase with the incident wave. Thus the incident wave is extinguished as it passes into the glass over a length of a few tenths of a micron (the extinction length). This exceedingly unlikely mechanism for extincting the incident wave gives the extinction theorem its odd name.

We can, if we can eliminate one surface from consideration -- and that's something we can do. By careful choice of coatings on one surface of the glass, we can (nearly) eliminate reflections, both internal and external, from that surface.

Light, as we know, consists of a combination of electric and magnetic waves, each being the cause and also the effect of the other, as they pass through, vacuum, in space, or the air, or glass, or water, etc. We can imagine that passage of the waves, particularly their speed, depends on how electric or magnetic fields behave in different media. And in the case of all media, the effect is that the speed of light is less than what it is in vacuum, and for most materials, less than what it is in air. This is why a light beam bends when it enters glass or water, and it is thanks to this that we have cameras, telescopes and the magnifying glass. Apart from affecting the speed and the direction of light, these properties of materials also affect how much of incident light would pass through or reflect off a surface.

What happens when light passes through a glass of milk? It enters the liquid, is scattered unpredictably at countless tiny particles and exits the glass again. This effect makes milk appear white. The specific paths that the incident light beam takes depend, however, on the opacity of the liquid: A transparent substance will allow the light to travel through on a straight line, in a turbid substance the light will be scattered numerous times, travelling on more complicated zig-zag trajectories.

We call this total internal reflection. Lenses and microscope. Museum of the History of Science, Oxford University. Now of course a beam of light isn't made up of lines of tiny people with their hands held together.

It also causes the total internal reflection effect. What's more, if you use the \"crack the whip\" analogy, and you calculate the geometry mathematics based on how fast the light moves in the different materials, you get exactly the angles that the light beam will travel in each case. Using this analogy actually gets you the right answer. As an analogy goes, that's pretty good. To finish off, let's return to the difference between lenses and prisms.

But in practice, this thickness tends to be very small compared to the lenses' focal length. Ignoring it makes the equations much simpler. So in introductory discussions of optics, physicists tend to use the \"thin lens\" approximation: pretend that the lens has no thickness, and is just a plane that magically changes the angle of any light that touches it. This makes it easier to discuss the most important properties of lenses (the way they focus or un-focus light to make images) without getting bogged down by smaller details. That's what's happening in this image: the diagram-maker is pretending that light only gets refracted once, when it passes through the magic plane, instead of twice, when it enters and exits the glass. (Of course, like any approximation, the thin lens approximation isn't perfect. Ignoring the actual details of the lens material means you can't predict things like chromatic aberration. So this approximation is mainly used to get an intuition for how lenses work, and isn't actually used in, say, manufacturing real lenses for cameras.)

Together the work of these two men is known as the Ewald-Oseen Extinction Theorem. What's so mysterious about how a window works. Isn't a window merely a sheet of glass? When light strikes a window some of it bounces off (about 10%) and the remainder is refracted (bent) into the glass at an angle that depends on a number \"n\" called the refractive index which is different for different materials. If n is greater than 1, the light bends deeper into the material; if n is less than 1, the light bends towards the surface. In a vacuum the speed of light is equal to a constant c. But in material media, the velocity v of light is equal to: v = c/n. For visible light in glass, the refractive index is about 1.5, so light travels at about 70% of its vacuum speed: inside glass, light travels SLOW.

The image is reversed because of how the path of light is refracted. Nope. The image is reversed because of reflection. The back of the mirror is silvered. Light must pass through the glass twice.

The mirror reflects light of an intensity and color that is identical to the light that would be passing through a piece of glass suspended at the same locale, i.e., as if the mirror were not there. Light coming from a 45\u00b0 angle above the horizontal and reflecting off the mirror and into the eyes of an observer located 45\u00b0 below horizontal is identical to light that would pass through the mirror if it were clear glass.

How does a piece of glass manage to reflect light from one side while remaining clear on the other? The secret is that it doesn't. A one-way mirror has a reflective coating applied in a very thin, sparse layer -- so thin that it's called a half-silvered surface. The name half-silvered comes from the fact that the reflective molecules coat the glass so sparsely that only about half the molecules needed to make the glass an opaque mirror are applied. At the molecular level, there are reflective molecules speckled all over the glass in an even film but only half of the glass is covered. The half-silvered surface will reflect about half the light that strikes its surface, while letting the other half go straight through. It turns out that half-silvered mirrors are also essential to many types of lasers -- see How Lasers Work for details. So why doesn't the \"criminal suspect\" see the detectives in the next room?

A: Not all the light shining on the top surface of your glass block can pass straight through the block. Inside the block, total internal reflection occurs at the side faces. The light which was \"supposed\" to exit through the sides is refracted to the inside. This causes the shadow you observe and a slighly brighter middle section, which is hard to see.

Take off your eyeglasses and place them on the table at night under the illumination of a single lamp and you will see a distinct shadow caused by the transparent lenses. Although air is almost perfectly transparent, it can still cast shadows via refraction. The key principle regarding refraction is that light is bent when the index of refraction differs from one location to the next. Air and glass are different materials and have different indices of refraction. Light therefore bends when it goes from air into glass, such as at the surface of a glass lens. Refraction does not happen inside a glass lens because the material inside the lens is uniform.

I looked up on the web but couldn't get a well written descriptive answer. Can someone please explain its working? Thanks in advance !!! A: If I have the right \"Lightboard\" in mind, these work by putting a piece of very transparent glass between the tutor and the camera. The glass has some white LEDS on the top and the bottom edges that send light through the glass (due to something called total internal reflection, the light does not exit the glass for the most part). When the tutor writes on the glass, this puts a thin layer of the fluorescent marker on the glass, and allows light to exit through where the writing is. This light reaches the camera and thus we can see the writing. Another interesting question is why doesn't the writing appear backwards since the tutor is behind the glass. It would, if you did not do anything to prevent this! Two ways to make the writing not be backwards: (1) point the camera at a mirror which reflects the tutor/lightboard (2) digitally flip the video image.

One fact you must bear in mind touching reflected heat: it does not heat the reflecting body. \"There is no need of telling you that light passes through certain substances. It passes through gases and through some liquids and some solids. The best of glass, though it is so solid, interposes very little hindrance to the passage of light. Heat in like manner radiates through certain solids. Luminous heat is radiated through glass. Rock-salt transmits dark heat also. A plate of alum permits light to pass, but stops both luminous heat and dark heat. Remember that transmitted heat, as was said of reflected heat, does not heat the body through which it passes. I have seen boys make burning-glasses of ice. The heat passes through them and burns that upon which it is concentrated, while the ice itself through which the heat passes is not melted. \"If a body have a good radiating surface, that is, if its surface be dull and rough, the heat which falls upon it will be mostly absorbed.

Light travels more quickly through air than it does through glass, so a lens slows it down. When light waves enter a piece of glass at an angle, one part of the wave will reach the glass before another and so will start slowing down first. This is something like pushing a shopping cart from pavement to grass, at an angle. The right wheel hits the grass first and so slows down while the left wheel is still on the pavement. Because the left wheel is briefly moving more quickly than the right wheel, the shopping cart turns to the right as it moves onto the grass. The effect on light is the same -- as it enters the glass at an angle, it bends in one direction. It bends again when it exits the glass because parts of the light wave enter the air and speed up before other parts of the wave. In a standard converging, or convex lens, one or both sides of the glass curves out. This means rays of light passing through will bend toward the center of the lens on entry.

While the phase-fronts don't fall on a nice smooth line, the light wave still travels perpendicular to the phase-front at every location. As a result, the light heads off in all directions. Amazingly, we can repair the damage to the light wave before it even happens. The glass distorts the phase-front in the same way every time, because the surface does not change much. So, if you measure that distortion, you can insert a device that modifies the phase-front in such a way that the light wave passes through the glass undisturbed.

If the medium, in the path of the light, bends the light or blocks certain frequencies of it, we can see separate colors.

Sample The sample should be adsorbed to the surface of the glass cover slide and stained with appropriate fluorophores to resolve the features desired within the sample. This is in protocol with any other fluorescent microscopy technique. Dichroic (Dichromatic) Filter The dichroic filter is an edge filter used at an oblique angle of incidence (typically 45\u00b0) to efficiently reflect light in the excitation band and to transmit light in the emission band. The 45\u00b0 angle of the filter separates the path of the excitation and emission beam. The filter is composed of a complex system of multiple layers of metals, metal salts and dielectrics which have been vacuum-deposited onto thin glass. This coating is designed to have high reflectivity for shorter wavelengths and high transmission for longer wavelengths. While the filter transmits the selected excitation light (shorter wavelength) through the objective and onto the plane of the specimen, it also passes emission fluorescence light (longer wavelength) to the barrier filter and reflecting any scattered excitation light back in the direction of the laser source. This maximizes the amount of exciting radiation passing through the filter and emitted fluorescence beam that is detected by the detector. Barrier"}, {"title": " ", "text": "used by Galileo. Newton solved the problem by swapping the lenses for curved mirrors so that the light rays did not have to pass through glass but reflected off it. At around the same time, the Dutch scientist CHRISTIAAN HUYGENS came up with the convincing but wholly contradictory theory that light travels in waves like ripples on a pond. Newton vigorously challenged anyone who tried to contradict his opinion on the theory of light, as Robert Hooke and Leibniz, who shared similar views to Huygens found out. Given Newton\u2019s standing, science abandoned the wave theory for the best part of two hundred years. 1704 \u2013 \u2018Optiks\u2019 published. In it he articulates his influential (if partly inaccurate) particle or corpuscle theory of light. Newton suggested that a beam of light is a stream of tiny particles or corpuscles, traveling at huge speed. If so, this would explain why light could travel through a vacu\u00fcm, where there is nothing to carry it. It also explained, he argued, why light travels in straight lines and casts sharp shadows \u2013 and is reflected from mirrors. His particle theory leads to an inverse square law that says that the intensity of light varies as the square of its distance from the source, just as gravity does. Newton was not dogmatic in Optiks, and shows an awareness of problems with the corpuscular theory.

Studying mathematical concepts of quantum mechanics, I have recently become familiar with the classical model of one-dimensional particle being scattered by a potential barrier. As a mathematician, I didn't really have an idea of where such model might be applied in practice. But I have observed that the window beside me has some interesting characteristics similar to this model. I can see both through it, and my reflection in it - clearly some light particles pass through the glass, and others are reflected with unchanged velocity. The thicker the glass would be, the less particles would pass - which is also true for increasing potential barrier width. If I substituted glass with shiny metal, no visible light would pass through and more particles would be reflected, which resembles increasing the potential value in the barrier. And finally (as far as the mathematician I am knows) not all electromagnetic waves pass through glass - which also seems related, because the amount of particles passing through barrier depends on the wave velocity/frequency. Is there actually some correlation between these models? Is the window semi-transparent behavior induced by this particular quantum scattering phenomena? Or maybe there is a more genera (universal) partial reflection model, that works both in the case of potential barrier and a glass window?"}, {"title": " ", "text": "definition of the concept while the example of the multimedia display provided was presented in Figure 7.

Proportion means it will scale the intensity down. But if k and x are greater than zero , then k*x will always be nonzero. The exception is when you reduce the intensity to less than a photon.

How do you know when it's time to get glasses? Short answer is, get an eye exam. If your eyes are bugging you in any way, it's time to get them checked out! But sometimes our vision changes without us realizing. Sometimes we just need a little more light for doing close-up work. Either way, you shouldn't be straining or squinting. Seeing well is important for healthy eye development and can be a matter of life and death, if you're a driver. So you're wondering \"Do I need glasses?\" You might, but there are a myriad of reasons why. The main cause of vision problems are refractive errors. When light passes through an object, it bends. This is called refraction. Light must pass through the cornea and the lens and reach the retina in order for you to see. When the shape of the eyeball or the cornea prevents light from focusing directly on the retina, that is a refractive error. The natural aging of the lens can also cause refractive errors.

That type of mirror doesn't reflect just one way - light from both sides are transmitted and reflected. It only works when there is a huge discrepancy in lighting conditions - for example, the interrogation room is brightly lit, while the observation room is dark. The mirror works by reflecting only a percentage of light. Since there is so much light coming from the interrogation room, whatever percentage that is reflected drowns out any light that is transmitted from the observation room, so to them it looks like a mirror. ref But from the language point of view, both 'one way mirror' and 'two way mirror' are synonymous. A: I think more commonly \"two-way mirror\" is used. It makes sense to think of the common mirror as a simple \"one-way mirror\". That makes some sense scientifically as the photons radiate off your body, then bounce off the mirror and into your eye. The photons are going one way (with a bounce).

A: As the other answer states, water is equally \"dispersive\" in the sense of how much the index of refraction changes for different wavelengths of light. However, the ability to see/detect/observe the effects of dispersion requires a good geometrical setup, and that requirement can be made more clear with some examples. Firstly, note that a normal glass prism is always a triangular prism, and shown with a thin beam of light passing through it and splitting apart. This is all deliberate: * *If you have the light pass through parallel sides, then the exit angle will be the same as the entry angle, and so you'd have to be able to tell the difference between colored beams of light all traveling parallel to one another.

The visible orange glow seems to be limited to the portion a finger's width away from the end of the rod, where we might expect the glass to be substantially hotter than the rod. So, what can we say? The glass is apparently transparent, or nearly so; it is glowing, but apparently quite a bit less strongly than the metal rod embedded in it. The second law predicts that transparent glass should glow less brightly than the opaque rod, and that to the extent that the glass glows, it must not be fully transparent. While these photos don't let us conclude anything quantitative about either the brightness or transparency of the glass, they seem to be consistent with what was predicted. Unfortunately we also can't tell from these pictures whether the glass has become any less transparent when heated to the point of glowing. This is an unsatisfactory conclusion, and I may add to this section if I can obtain some more quantitative results.

When the paint is laid on so thick that under ordinary conditions of light the glass is obscure, or when it is so heavy that the light necessary to illuminate it is more than is good for the rest of the window, the bounds of moderation have surely been passed. And in the latter half of the sixteenth century it was less and less the custom to take heed of considerations other than pictorial; so that by degrees the translucency of glass was sacrificed habitually to strength of effect depending not so much upon colour, which is the strength of glass, as upon the relief obtained by shadow, just the one quality not to be obtained in glass painting. For the quality of shadow depends upon its transparency; and shadow painted upon glass, through which the light is to come, must needs be obscure, must lack, in proportion as it is dark, the mysterious quality of light in darkness, which is the charm of shadow.

We tend to take windows for granted, without giving much thought to how they benefit us. In essence, windows allow light to enter a structure, while blocking the movement of heat. They prevent heat transfer by three different mechanisms. First, as a physical barrier to the outward movement of the indoor air, they block loss of heat by convection. Secondly, because glass conducts heat poorly, the loss of heat by conduction is slow. Finally, the most common types of glass, while transparent to visible light, strongly absorb infrared (heat) radiation. Thus, glass inhibits the loss of heat by radiation from the contents of the room. Without glass windows, we either must live in totally enclosed rooms, lit only by artificial lighting (which has its own problems), or we must let light in through simple openings, which also allow hard-won heat to escape. In 1632, glass windows were expensive enough so that only a chosen few could enjoy their advantages. The quality of the window glass is a further indication of the power or affluence of the owner.

By comparison, in hot environments, the glasses will take longer to release heat and lose their shading properties. There are two ways to apply this darkening material. In the beginning, manufacturers mixed the material in with the glass, so that it permeated the lenses. But the glass versions of photochromatic glasses were heavy and awkward, and as technology advanced, they were replaced with both plastic and polycarbonate materials. The silver halide substance was mixed in with these materials in the same way, but the glasses were much lighter and more flexible. Since the lens material darkened throughout with this permeation approach, how dark the lens become depended on how thick it was.

Feature contributed by James Carpenter, founder, James Carpenter Design Associates Inc. What is the significance of glass in the built environment? Light carries information about the world around us and glass allows us to layer many different components of light simultaneously, augmenting our ability to share a transcendent experience of nature. Beyond the problems defining glass scientifically, I am interested in the simultaneity that glass possesses. It is a dense material with the ability to appear weightless and its mass is literally transparent, but once we understand the full range of optical properties found in glass - transparency, reflection, diffusion, refraction and diffraction \u2013 it becomes evident that glass has the potential to capture and represent many levels of light information simultaneously, and that this information can also be deployed across the depth of the glass at all scales. Often called upon as an interpreter of a site\u2019s inherent natural character, my studio has remained focused on the transformative potential of integrating phenomenal light into the public realm while proving our expertise in both the technical details of glass construction and techniques required to integrate light into the urban fabric.

See Appendix I, Section I.4, for an explanation of this alternate method of testing models. **Figure 9.17g** No matter how complicated the shading problem is, physical modeling can help the designer. Reflections from a pool are also simulated. Also note the sundial, which can be used as an alternative method to test models (see Appendix I).

Importantly, Claesz harmonized his arrangements with a remarkable sensitivity to light. In this painting, light flooding the scene creates shadows along the folds and creases of the tablecloth.[9] [9] A somewhat undefined diagonal between the pewter pitcher and the rose in the muted background may be a suggestion of light falling onto the scene from the upper left. A similar effect is also found in the Rijksmuseum painting, but in that instance a clearer distinction exists between the dark area to the left of the diagonal and the lighter wall to its right. The objects on the table cast shadows of varied weight and density, among them the cream-colored shadows caused by light passing through a translucent glass of wine. Particularly remarkable is the array of reflections Claesz captured on the surface of the bulbous-shaped pewter pitcher, including various images of the sunlit window and even the effect of light passing through the berkemeier.

Diffuse lighting, on the other hand, causes objects to lose their volume, while shadows and outlines to become smoother. Six main types of light space based on the directions of light flows are formulated: directed contrast, directed, selectively directed, variable, reflected, diffuse. The use of light filters that change the spectral composition of the light flow opens up a wide range of possibilities for the architect. The use of chromatic light -a technique that has been widely used in Gothic cathedral stained-glass windows -has an incredibly powerful effect on human emotions.

In its essence every film is a special effect of still photography, animated by projection at 24 frames per second, which contains many other special effects. One of the partially revealed images to appear through separated curtains in for nights bathed in sodium vapour is a cuculoris.

I have read about schlieren photography, which uses the ability of non-uniform air to create shadows. Is it really possible that air makes shadows? A: In addition to V.Joe's excellent answer about refraction, I want to add that air does directly block (absorb, not refract) some infrared and ultra-violet light. If your eyes could see light in the infrared and UV spectrums, air would appear partially opaque in those wavelengths. The surface of the earth is in the infrared and UV 'shadow' of the atmosphere. A: Taken from this site: Yes, air can indeed make shadows. A shadow occurs when an object in a light beam prevents some of the light from continuing on in the forward direction. When the light beam hits a wall or the ground, a darker shape is visible where less light is hitting the surface. Both the light and the shadow, which is just the absence of light, travel to the surface at the speed of light. There are three ways that an object can prevent light from continuing on in the forward direction: Absorption: The light that hits the object is absorbed and converted to heat. A black table creates a shadow on the wall mostly by absorbing the light that hits it.

There is a certain class of bodies which obstruct the passage of the rays of light, and where light is not, a shadow is cast, and the substance producing the shadow is said to be opaque. Wood, stone, the metals, charcoal, are all examples of opacity; whilst glass, talc, and horn allow a certain number of the rays to travel through their particles, and are therefore called transparent. Nature, however, never indulges in sudden extremes, and as no substance is so opaque as not (when reduced in thickness) to allow a certain amount of light to pass through its substance, so, on the other hand, however transparent a body may be, a greater or lesser number of the rays are always stopped, and hence opacity and transparency are regarded as two extremes of a long chain; being connected together by numerous intermediate links, they pass by insensible gradations the one into the other.

Question 31. Why is the moon not considered as a luminous body? Answer: Moon is a non-luminous body because it shines by reflecting the sunlight falling on it. Question 1. What is reflection? Answer: When a ray of light falls on a smooth and shiny surface, the whole of light is sent back in the same medium. It is called reflection. Mirrors do not allow even a small amount of light to pass through them. Mirrors show regular and complete reflection. Question 2. Why do we need a shiny surface for reflection? Answer: The extent of reflection depends upon the shine and smoothness of the surface. More is the shine and smoothness of the surface, more will be the reflection. That is why mirrors reflect most of the light falling on it. Hence, for reflection, shiny surfaces are required. Question 3. Can you think of a situation where we can see the path of the light?

Another complication is that the transparency of a substance varies depending on the wavelength of the light. The same object may be transparent to some wavelengths, and opaque to others. Ordinary glass, for example, is transparent to the visible wavelengths, but does a pretty lousy job of transmitting ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Adding certain materials or coatings to the glass can make it even more selective, resulting in filters that only transmit certain colors. Light that we perceive as white often really has equal amounts of all colors (or wavelengths) in the visible range of the spectrum, as discussed in the previous chapter. In the rest of this chapter, for the most part, we will ignore effects that depend on wavelength and concentrate on more general behaviors of visible light. For example, you are probably familiar with the phenomenon of shadows. If you have a single small source of light in a room, any opaque object will cast a sharp shadow on a wall or floor, and that shadow will have the shape of the outline of the object.

To the extent that the glass is glowing, it must not be transparent. Though the glow of hot glass may be dimmer than the glow of equally hot opaque material (such as steel) I none the less recalled it as being quite bright -- far brighter than one would expect if it were radiating only a tiny fraction as much light as hot metal.

There is a tiny bit of truth to the legend. At the molecular level, glass does \"flow\", it just does so very verrry sloooowly. Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide in Australia, has performed detailed calculations on old cathedral windows, and estimates that it would take at least 10 million years for the glass at the bottom to grow just 5% thicker. She emphasizes that this is a conservative estimate; it might take much longer. So there's frankly no way in hell that the irregularities in medieval cathedral windows are due to the flowing properties of glass. Instead, the observed anomalies are probably due to inherent flaws resulting from the manufacturing process.

Why can we see through it when other materials are opaque? Glasses exist in a poorly understood state somewhere between solids and liquids. In general, when a liquid is cooled there is a temperature at which it will \u201cfreeze\u201d, becoming a crystalline solid (eg. water into ice at 0C). Most solid inorganic materials are crystalline and are made up of many millions of crystals, each having an atomic structure which is highly ordered, with atomic units tessellating throughout. The shape of these units can be observed in the shape of single crystals (eg. hexagonal quartz crystals). Glass is different: it is not crystalline but made up of a continuous network of atoms that are not ordered but irregular and liquid-like. This difference in atomic structure occurs because the liquid glass is cooled so quickly that the atoms do not have time to arrange themselves into regular, crystal-like patterns. If cooled fast enough almost any liquid can form glass, even water. However, the rate of cooling must be very fast. Fortunately for us, liquids composed primarily of silicon oxide can be cooled slowly and still form a glass. They get gradually stiffer during cooling until they reach the \u201cglass transition temperature\u201d below which they are effectively solid.

If you were putting a fragile, heavy pane of glass into a window frame, would you place the thicker edge or the thinner edge at the bottom, where all the weight of the pane would be resting?

So bending even a relatively thin rod of glass will cause the outer curve to have to stretch far more than the glass is capable of doing. This is why glass must be extremely thin to allow bending at all. Remember the thinner the material the less stretching that outer curve must do. So we know how things bend, and that sort of helps us, but we really need to know is why do they break?

Or: Since the water is displaced higher up onto the glass, there is more force from gravity pulling the water molecules downwards which then sends a chain reaction of collisions downwards towards the bottom of the glass. The overall effect is that the molecules at the bottom of the glass now are hit more frequently and at faster speeds due to the downward chain of collisions caused by gravity and this results in more and faster hits on the glass.

This process creates a solid piece of glass in the shape of whatever mold was used. Glass casting commonly occurs through kiln casting, but it can also be done by casting into metal, graphite, or sand molds.

Over the centuries the glass had become thicker at the bottom and developed the waves that were now projected onto the cold stone wall. Although it was clean, barely enough light made it through to illuminate the room giving it a dingy, almost dungeon-like feel. By Angela Abraham, @daisydescriptionari, November 16, 2014. The frosted window cast an array of diffuse swirls onto the blue vinyl, giving it the impression of being a small sea shimmering in the early summer light. A beacon of light pierced through the mullioned panes of glass, bathing the black and white tile floor in a crisscross of iridescent colour; illuminating the darkened room. Two young children fascinated by the great shafts of light, ran towards the beams and tried to touch the solid luminous checkerboard. Just like the dust particles in the sunlight, they flitted between the beams, playfully bounding to avoid the dark. By beth, January 13, 2015.

A[i][j] = 0 if there is no mouse in cell (i, j), else it is 1, if there is a single mouse. LE is scared of a mouse if he moves into a position (x, y) where the distance between himself and the mouse <= 1. Given that he needs to reach the bottom right corner of the grid (N-1, M-1), and that he takes only right/down moves, find the minimum number of mice he will be scared by along such a path. # Explanation: In order to solve this, let us first make a visualization: each mouse casts a \"shadow\" of length 1 in all four directions. Thus, LE gets scared of a mouse iff his path passes through its \"shadow\". Note that if it passes through the mouse itself, then it would have had to come through some shadow, and further it would go through some shadow, so we can consider it as if it has passed through the shadow only. Thus, let us assume that we have a shadow grid, where shadow[i][j] = Number of mice that cast a shadow on cell (i, j). Finding the number of mice that LE is scared of, is then just summing up values of shadow!! Well, nearly that. The fact is, we are double-counting. In case the path that LE takes crosses the same mouse's shadow more than once, we would be counting that shadow twice as"}, {"title": " ", "text": "over the general mass of the house unifying all its separate parts.

The principal wall material unlike many of Waterhouse's contemporary designs is a dark mahogany/brown brick combined with beautiful red/brown plane tiles and gables which are heavily half-timbered and pargetted with rough cast. Interestingly, Waterhouse was to choose a similar brick when he built his own house \"The Gables\" in Neutral Bay - between 1920 and 1923. The tall chimneys have their own gabled roofs and are almost a trademark of a Waterhouse design from this period. The large semi-circular arch which defined the front verandah of Tulkiyan echoes a favourite architectural motif of the great American architect, Henry Hobson Richardson.

Live audiences, primarily consisting of elementary and middle school-aged students, learn about an understudied time, place, and art form. They come away from the experience with a heightened appreciation for the arts and greater esteem for the Spanish language and the diverse cultures across the globe that claim it as their native tongue. Professors looking for experiential learning opportunities for their students will discover that outreach through shadow puppets is an excellent way to connect their students to Spanish-speaking communities. This includes training students to become performers themselves. 8 In just a few hours, an inexperienced cast of would-be puppeteers can learn how to perform with shadow puppets. In May 2019, Dragoncillo visited Buena Vista University and briefly rehearsed Second Hands and the Ladies' Man with university students, preparing them to perform at elementary schools in Storm Lake, Iowa, and the surrounding areas. The contagious laughter, thoughtful questions, and generous praise from the audience created a unique and beneficial experience for the performers and audience members alike. Each performer had the opportunity to practice using a shadow puppet, impart dialogue, and teach about a critical period of Hispanic theater history. Each audience member was able to experience a shadowpuppet performance, ask pertinent questions, and learn about Golden Age Spain. Dragoncillo's bilingual approach to outreach ensures that students of all backgrounds recognize the rich cultural history and artistic inheritance of the Spanish language.

On the wrist is a bracelet with an iron chain (which can be clearly seen), covered by a very thin aluminum plaque (so thin as to be invisible). The bones of the hand and wrist can be seen clearly; the flesh, only faintly. A radiochromometer, a device used to measure radiation dose and energy, is shown beside the hand. This device is now easily understood to be only a series of metal plates of varying density and thickness. Only a woman would think to explain radiation absorption and measurement using jewelry.

It comprises the 25th and 26th episodes of the seventh season and is the 177th and 178th episodes of the series overall. It aired on May 23, 1994. The title is derived from the expression \"All good things must come to an end\", a phrase used by the character Q during the episode itself. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. The plot involves Captain Jean-Luc Picard jumping through time and the formation of an anomaly that defies causality, the whole situation being a test that allows Picard to demonstrate human potential to the Q Continuum by making an intuitive jump of thought to understand the cause of, and how to eliminate, the anomaly before it destroys humanity. The finale was generally well received, and marked the transition of the cast to films featuring the show's cast and settings, as well as passing the television audience to Star Trek spin-offs based on similar settings to The Next Generation. Plot Capt. Jean-Luc Picard inexplicably finds his mind jumping among three points in time: the present (stardate 47988); seven years earlier, just prior to the starship USS Enterprise-D's first mission during the episode \"Encounter at Farpoint\"; and over twenty-five years into the future, where an aged Picard has retired to the family vineyard in La Barre, France.

For not only does it sum up the books attempt to depict the fall of Dublin, but it does so in a way that we see such through Joyces very eyes. For we see just how strongly Joyce felt, that had he remained in Dublin forever, it wouldve have fully consumed him into what can be described as a kind of black hole. A darkness representative of a depression that would have turned Joyce into a shade as he believed it did to many that remained. And when one says shade one means a shadow. However, the meaning of shadow, in this case, is twofold depending on how strong the readers link to Irish culture is. For example, to someone that has no relations whatsoever with Ireland and at its history, a shadow may simply be interpreted as a dark figure cast on the ground or some surface by a body intercepting light. On the other hand though, to someone like Joyce, that body intercepting the light was Dublin itself.

In these cases, mix your easy gray with French Ultramarine blue and Burnt Sienna, emphasizing the blue. ### Two Exceptions to the Rule There are two exceptions to this rule. The first deals with transparency and translucency. In a transparent or translucent object, both the body shadow and the cast shadow are affected by the fact that light passes through the object rather than being blocked. There is no shadow side on an object when light passes through it; a translucent object, such as a flower petal, will actually be brighter on that side. Light passing through transparent color will also throw both color and light into the cast shadow. (See Still Life with Peaches.) The second exception has to do with the tendency of nearby colors to reflect into each other in very strong light. In the study of the blue mug below you will notice that some of the pink of the cloth is reflected into the mug. In the painting of the orange in the page following, the shiny orange is picking up a strong reflected light from the napkin underneath it and bouncing it back down into the cast shadow. Study the shadows of a blue mug on a pink cloth. Notice how the pink cloth reflects back into the mug. Notice how the intense orange reflects down into the cast shadow on the white cloth. ### An Addition to the Rule The sun imparts a hint of yellow to every sunlit color because our sun is yellow.

I will have you look at the cast carefully now, and I want you to see that if you squint that plane beneath his jaw fades away into the shadow itself. Only when you open your eyes fully, does it appear different. Now, one of the reasons for this is that direct light is always stronger than reflected light. So the light here or here or here, here, here, any of this is always going to be a lighter value than any reflected light within the shadow pattern. So one way of thinking of it is that nothing, not even the lightest light within your shadow can be as light as the darkest, dark within your halftime. Nothing in your light can be as dark as the lightest form in the shadow. Oh, but that looks just as light. You'll say, when you look at it with your eyes open. Squint and you'll see, it's not. And it cannot be because after all, how could reflect the light equal or surpass the light value of direct light. At most, the reflected light is only a reflection of direct light.

In the diagram Diagram V, let A represent the plan of a cone, B C the opening of a window, and D the eye of the spectator, and E F G the wall of a room. Light travels in straight lines from the window, strikes the surface of the cone, and is reflected to the eye, making the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection, the angle of incidence being that made by the light striking an object, and the angle of reflection that made by the light in leaving the surface. It will be seen that the lines B1D, C2D are the limits of the direct rays of light that come to the eye from the cone, and that therefore between points 1 and 2 will be seen the highest light.

If the direction is bent enough, the light that passes through the object will be angled out of the forward-traveling beam. As a result, the beam will have a dark spot; a shadow. A shadow itself represents the blocking out of light and, therefore, implies the existence of some lurking darkness or source of evil. \u2026 The night serves as a backdrop to the human potential to lead a life of goodness. However, the nature of man also makes him susceptible to the evil forces in his world of darkness. Shadows are made by blocking light. Light rays travel from a source in straight lines. If an opaque (solid) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from traveling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. What Is Constraints And Its Types?

The clear light marks resounding shadows that strongly draw the volumes, and the facades, with the appearance of bright wood, they are vigorously cut out on the intense blue of the sky. Straight lines shadows contrast with those of their dividing neighbors. At OOIIO, we believe that the simplicity of the volumes often enriches the whole, so it was decided to even hide the window frames. The adornments on the facades would impoverish the architecture; and likewise any type of eaves or roof would be a coronation of the facade much less noble than the simplicity of the clean edges that cut the horizontal plane on the infinite blue. Light and its unseparated Shadow, called vulgarly opposed, are necessary to establish the limits of a space. The good application of this duality can be crucial to make a comfortable place or not, because they strengthen or weaken the volumes that create the architecture, and the gaps that make us enjoy it.

Let's start with the basics on the direction of light and how it can affect a photo.(Reported by: Ryosuke Takahashi) Relationship between the light direction and the resultant shadow on the subject Control the light and shadow to match the image of the photo you want to take The shadow appearing on a subject is directly related to the direction of the light striking the subject. If the light strikes the subject directly from the front, no shadows will appear as they will be cast behind the subject. However, as the light is moved sidewaysa strong shadow will be cast in the direction opposite to the direction of the light. Shadows are necessary to impart a sense of solidity to the subject and its effects are used in actual photography as well. If you can understand the relationship between the direction of the light and the finishing, your photography skills will definitely improve. Semi-front light Semi-backlight Backlight compensation You will find that the shadow appears on the side opposite to the direction of the light.

ILLUSTRATING CURVED LINKS SUGGESTING FULLNESS AND FORESHORTENING I should not have troubled the reader with this tedious diagram were it not that certain facts about light and shade can be learned from it. The first is that the high lights come much more within the edge of the object than you would have expected. With the light directly opposite point 7, one might have thought the highest light would have come there, and that is where many students put it, until the loss of roundness in the appearance of their work makes them look more carefully for its position. So remember always to look out for high lights within the contours of forms, not on the edges. The next thing to notice is that the darkest part of the shadow will come nearest the lights between points 3 and 5. This is the part turned most away from the direction of the greatest amount of reflected light, and therefore receiving least. The lightest part of the shadow will be in the middle, rather towards the side away from the light, generally speaking. The shadow cast on the ground will be dark, like the darkest part of the shadow on the cone, as its surface is also turned away from the chief source of reflected light. Although the artist will very seldom be called upon to draw a cone, the same principles of light and shade that are so clearly seen in such a simple figure obtain throughout the whole of nature.

It is light that reflects into a shadow from surrounding lights. In the image on the facing page you can see that the shadow on the sphere is not solid, but gets lighter near the bottom edge. That is because light is bouncing off the tabletop and reflecting into the sphere. Reflected light may come from many sources\u2014another wall or ceiling, or perhaps (in an outdoor setting) the sky. These lights bounce into the shadow side of the object most strongly in places where the reflecting surface is either very close, as in the tabletop in our drawing, or very strong, as from a bright sky. The only time you will not see reflected light is if the object is completely surrounded with black. Add and label the light areas. Too many reflected lights can break up the shadow patterns that give strength to a design, so sometimes they should be ignored or downplayed. When the background is light, don't put the reflected light on your object right at the edge or you won't be able to see that edge. Instead, bring it slightly inside and darken the edge enough so that it shows up against the background.

The absence of light, darkness, is often overlooked by a lot of photographers because they are too busy concentrating on the light. Shadows play an important role in bringing images to life.

Experiment C showed that the disk surface was mainly perceived as a plane shape in the gray conditions, and as a convex shape in the gradation conditions, irrespective of the shadow position. In this article, we have referred to some assumptions in perceiving shape from shading, for example, the light-from-above or single-light-source assumption (e.g., Ramachandran, 1988aRamachandran, , 1988b. In addition, we have also referred to a preference, that is, the convexity preference (e.g., Hill & Bruce, 1994). Assumption and preference are similar here in the point that both make a bias in perceptual interpretation, apart from their concepts. Although the light-from-above assumption has been well established in previous studies, the assumption was totally overturned by the convexity preference in Experiment C. As a result, lighting direction information from shading was incidentally determined; that is, the light may come from the bright side of the shading. The lighting direction suggested by shading also affected cast shadow interpretation, as shown in the shaded disk conditions in Experiment A.

This is because the sun is directly overhead, casting harsh shadows on everything. This means that an athlete\u2019s face will be covered in shadows cast by their helmet. The only way to slightly counter-act this effect is by adding some flash to fill in the shadows. However, the overall light will still look harsh. Here\u2019s an example of midday light that was counter-balanced with a flash to create good looking results. An hour before sunset, and an hour after sunrise (unfortunately you will have to get up early\u2026) are the best times of day to shoot (location depending, in canyons or dark valleys you may have to add another couple hours just to have light\u2026).

Beam Natural light is something that we are accustomed to and we take it for granted that there is usually one strong source of light that casts light from above and scattered light from the sky and only minor fraction of the light is reflected from bright objects around. Its quality is composed of all the wavelengths of the spectrum and therefore is perceived as being white. That means that the natural angle of lighting is from above the line of sight, which is often reproduced in interiors as well. Similarly, concerning the quality, though qualities change, it is white light as well. We are used to the environment, where the predominant angle of light comes from above and is white. That shapes usual perception of faces, where the natural light creates shadows below nose and chin. Reversal of this situation happens, when a flashlight cast light onto the face from below, as any child would remember, and cast shadows create an unusual face, the scary one. And between these two examples, there lies a variety of possibilities. Shadows that are cast by the sun have sharp edges, because the rays fall from large distance, similar to the light from a spot light lantern.

We estimate the rotation, translation, and scale of the shape and align the $3$D face to the $2$D image. To generate the shadow mask, we cast parallel rays along the $z$-axis towards the mesh. If the ray hits the face, we check for two kinds of shadows at the intersection point: self shadows and cast shadows. Portions of the face between the light source and the intersection point will block the light and cast a shadow. To determine if the point lies in a cast shadow, we cast a ``shadow feeler'' ray from the intersection point to the light source~\\cite{appel1968some}. If the ray hits the surface, the intersection point is in a cast shadow. To determine if the point lies in self shadow, we compute the angle between the light source's direction and the surface normal of the intersection point. If the angle is obtuse, the light is from the back of the surface and the point is in self shadow.

One of the two purposes of this study was to investigate whether there was an assumption of light from above or from another orientation in the perception of cast shadows. If the assumption of light from above is adopted, a cast shadow may be preferred below the object. The other purpose was to confirm the perceptual interaction between shading and cast shadows (Casati, 2014). As the perception of shading and cast shadows has often been studied separately, it is unclear whether one actually affects the other. In this study, we investigated whether shading affected the perception of ambiguous cast shadows from the viewpoint of matching direction. If shading has an influence on the perception of cast shadows, the directional preference of a cast shadow should be enhanced or degraded by adding matched or unmatched shading information, respectively. To test these hypotheses, we performed three experiments in a random order for each participant. The first one was the main experiment of the present article (Experiment A).

Conversely, in the white-on-bottom condition, the dominance of the light-from-below judgments was significant in the positions between 9.1% and 50%, 100% (0%), and in the no-cast-shadow condition.

Shadow volume techniques are out because they don't work for semi-transparent texture stacks, so it's got to be shadow maps. Generating a shadow map on the fly requires a shadow camera pass over clouds. I know from prior experience optimizing cloud rendering performance by means of a z-buffer filling first pass that any second pass over clouds is prohibitively expensive - any attempt to pass over clouds a second time drove me below 10 fps for even moderately clouded scenes. If I were to speculate, I'd say that this is the reason clouds in Rembrandt don't cast any shadows in spite of Rembrandt being easily able to include clouds in the shadow camera pass.

In the following example, the height of the Sun and the Size multiplier are adjusted, while values for attributes like Shadow Subdivs (at 32) and Intensity multiplier (at 1.0) are constant.

We then address critical software architecture issues in making the development of our system tractable. The complex dependences between multipass effects, the indirect framebuffer, and progressive refinement made it important to develop an abstraction to facilitate the inclusion of new effects and manage dependences, as well as abstract key low-level aspects such as data-flow and bindings on the GPU.

The difference between ray casting and ray tracing is that tracing is done recursively while casting is not. By that I mean that in ray tracing after a primary ray from your eye hits a point in the scene you then spawn new reflected and or refracted rays from that intersection point and those rays spawn other rays and so on. In ray casting you just stop with the first hit and call it good enough. Consequently ray traced scenes can (and ususally do) have lots of interreflections between objects with mirror-like surfaces, but in Wolfenstein and Doom everything is opaque and diffuse. Now there is such a thing as tracing rays from the lights, but nowadays that is typically referred to as \"backwards raytracing\" which is confusing because physically speaking that's forwards. So some confusion is understandable. But techniques that use this backwards raytracing typically just do a pass with backwards tracing to deposit light in the scene, and then actually do the rendering with a more conventional raytracing pass (from the eye).

Beam tracing\\'s performance has been hindered by complex geometry intersection tests, and a lack of good acceleration structures with efficient algorithms to traverse them. We introduce fast new algorithms for beam tracing, specifically for beam--triangle intersection and beam--kd-tree traversal. The result is a beam tracer capable of calculating precise primary visibility and point light shadows in real-time. Moreover, beam tracing provides full area elements instead of point samples, which allows us to maintain coherence through to secondary effects and utilize the GPU for high quality antialiasing and shading with minimal extra cost.

In the video example, the head of the lamp has a very soft shadow while the base retains its hard edges, just like in real life. This would be very difficult to achieve using conventional techniques. Additionally, implementing ray traced shadows in game engines enables you to have many shadows casting lights because sampling decisions are made on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In the scene above, half of the pixels don\u2019t need to sample the headlights of the car because those lights can be rejected by cheap cone-test. There is no need for a separate pass to handle each dynamic shadow casting light. Another use case for ray tracing is reflections, which can be handled in a similar fashion to shadows. Instead of directing the ray towards a known light source, we send the ray in the direction calculated by performing the mathematical reflect function between the vector from the viewpoint and the normal vector at the surface. Ray traced reflections have several advantages over raster techniques like reflection maps. Not only do they reflect dynamic objects without needing separate rendering passes, nearby objects and self-reflections are handled perfectly.

Another method is to do the sampling yourself using a Poisson distribution. However, Exponential Shadow Maps go an entirely different route with this. Exponential Shadow Maps store a part of the approximation of the shadow casting test, and allows us to recombine it later for the actual approximation. The whole equation for Exponential Shadow Maps is as follows: $\\dpi{150} S_f(x) = e^{cz}e^{-cd}$ In the above algorithm, c is some constant chosen by the user, z is the actual rendered depth from the light\u2019s perspective, and d is the depth which we are testing against.

Homogeneous light passing through the two holes gives light and dark stripes on the screen. How is this effect to be understood from the point of view of the quantum theory of light? We could argue: a photon passes through either one of the two pinholes. If a photon of homogeneous light represents an elementary light particle, we can hardly imagine its division and its passage through the two holes. But then the effect should be exactly as in the first case, light and dark rings and not light and dark stripes. How is it possible then that the presence of another pinhole completely changes the effect? Apparently the hole through which the photon does not pass, even though it may be at a fair distance, changes the rings into stripes!

Consider waves of water that are incident from the left on a barrier with a narrow opening. First, suppose the opening is small compared with the wavelength of the waves. The water sloshing up and down in the opening acts as a point source of new waves. As a result, concentric waves are produced on the far side of the barrier. As the opening is widened, however, waves produced on the far side no longer emanate from a pointlike source, and the resulting waves are now less circular in shape. When the opening is very wide compared with the wavelength of the waves, the waves incident from the left simply pass through the opening unobstructed and undergo only slight diffraction at the edges. For light waves, this slight diffractive effect blurs the edges of a shadow. If the light source is very small (preferably a point), dark and bright fringes will be seen.

Whenever waves pass through an opening that is so small that the wavelength of the waves passing through it seems large in comparison, the waves passing through it diffract. Since light is a wave phenomenon (according to the wave theory of light), it should behave in the same way, and it does. If we place a light source behind a cut-out like the one below, it casts a projection on the wall like this one: This is analogous to sea waves entering the large harbor mouth. The width of the cut-out is millions of times larger than the wavelength of the light. As a result, the light waves go straight through it, following straight lines and projecting onto the wall a figure with the same shape as the cut-out. Notice especially that this projection has distinct borders between the bright area and the dark area.

A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises.

Moreover, equation (3) shows that whereas the height h of the PD sensor enters directly into the calculation of raw responsivity to shadow displacement, its lateral width w does not. Clearly, for the highest displacement responsivity, and given a certain semiconductor technology (e.g. silicon PDs, with r = 0.6 A W \u22121 , say), the height h of, as well as the irradiance I 0 at, the PD should be maximized. Furthermore, equation (3) shows that the difference in shadow depth at the element's edges, and so the sensitivity to displacement, can be maximized by arranging for the shadow to fall over only one edge of the detector-and there along the line of greatest shadow depth. In the case of an illuminated silica glass fibre, the shadow it casts arises from strong refraction (as through a cylindrical lens), and a small amount of reflection, at its cylindrical surface. A well-collimated illuminating beam, from a source of small angular divergence, decreases the otherwise unavoidable region of penumbra behind such a fibre: the incident light cannot pass around the fibre into the region of shadow behind it.

When we do a simple experiment of holding a lighter in one hand and a light source behind it, it shows no shadow on the wall at all. Why is this happening? Is it because the flame is pure energy and doesn't have matter in it, or is it due to light passing through the flame and not getting reflected? If it is, why isn't the light getting reflected or retracted? A: Imagine that you have a titanium screen. It's thin, so it's difficult to see. You can use a torch to heat some areas to incandescence. These areas become easily visible. Now if we take a very bright light source and shine them at these lit areas, we won't see a shadow that gives us any information about the pattern of the light. Both the cool and hot areas interact with the bright light beam in the same way. The grid itself may be visible, but the pattern won't reflect anything about the relationship between the dark and light regions. The flame is the same thing. It contains matter (such as fuel or soot particles), but similar matter is also present outside the flame. The imaging light may be slightly attenuated by these particles, but there is no sharp division in their location that corresponds to the shape of the flame. This lack of sharp division will prevent imaging.

For List, the fact that some do not underwrites the truth of the proposition 'the green light could have come on instead' at the higher level of description. But this seems intuitively the wrong way to describe things. We are talking about that specific atom and we know (with hindsight) that because of deterministic physics and the set-up, that particular atom could not have been elsewhere as described in physical space then. But that fact just is what decides whether the lights come on red or green. We know that the atom described in the physical frame could not have been at that part of space necessary to cause the green light to come on. And hence, it seems very hard with this information in hand, to continue to maintain that the green light could have come on instead. Rather than by hindsight, we can deliver the same result by having the forward-looking physical level information instead. Let us stipulate that we also have an electron microscope or particle detector array that is capable of measuring the exact velocity of the atom post release. Once we have this information, we can immediately see whether the atom will pass through the slit or not.

If light was carried by particles that moved in straight lines, what light pattern would you expect to see on the last screen? # EM Basics If light was carried by particles moving in straight lines, we\u2019d expect a simple screen pattern with two bright lines. Light would only be able to reach the final screen if it traveled in a straight line from the light source, through the slit in the first screen, and through one of the slits in the second screen. Since there are two slits in the second screen, this gives two possible paths for light to reach the last screen. Surprisingly, this was not what Young observed from his experiment. The result of Young\u2019s experiment was a pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes: This result can be explained if we think of light as being carried by waves rather than particles.

The slits are one-fifth of a millimetre apart, and illuminated by a parallel-sided beam of pure red light from a laser on the other side of the barrier. Why laser light and not torchlight? Only because the precise shape of a shadow also depends on the colour of the light in which it is cast; white light, as produced by a torch, contains a mixture of all visible colours, so it can cast shadows with multicoloured fringes. Therefore in experiments about the precise shapes of shadows we are better off using light of a single colour. We could put a coloured filter (such as a pane of coloured glass) over the front of the torch, so that only light of that colour would get through. That would help, but filters are not all that discriminating. A better method is to use laser light, for lasers can be tuned very accurately to emit light of whatever colour we choose, with almost no other colour present.

However, I can think of a few reasons why you might want to keep a rewards credit card in your wallet. Years ago, banking executives complained loudly about consumers who carried their credit cards without running up a monthly balance. Then, personal lending flipped itself upside down.

But here's the thing: Debit and credit cards may be nearly equal in their convenience of use when shopping for small items (eliminating the need to carry weighty pockets, jingling with unwanted coins). But they're not at all equal in the financial benefits they convey to a consumer. But rewards are only the most obvious monetary benefit of choosing credit over debit. Consider: When you pay for a purchase -- large or small -- with a debit card, that money is almost immediately deducted from your account. Granted, with the ultra-low interest rates that banks are paying on checking accounts these days, free float isn't as profitable as it used to be -- probably only pennies per credit card billing cycle. But still, free money is free money. Are you going to turn it down because you're not being offered enough free money? Of course, you do need to remember to pay your credit card bill on time, so as not to get hit by late fees. But as long as you can manage that, a credit card isn't really a card you use for taking out long-term credit at all. It's a pay-once-a-month debit card -- that pays you free money every month.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (SEC) recently issued an investor alert listing some of the risks associated with using credit cards to buy investments or to fund an investment account. The SEC reminds investors that most licensed and registered investment firms do not allow their customers to invest using a credit card, and urges investors not to attempt to use a credit card to fund their investments. Here are five things to consider before using a credit card to invest. Pressure to use a credit card to invest might be a sign of a scam. The SEC alert warns that if someone is asking you to use a credit card to purchase a stock, bond, other interest in a company or other investment opportunity, be wary.

But they aren\u2019t credit cards. There are serious differences between prepaid debit cards vs credit cards, and you should be aware of what they are. In function, a prepaid debit acts a lot like a credit card. You swipe a piece of plastic, and you are able to complete a purchase. Most prepaid debit cards even come branded with the logos of prominent credit card payment processors like MasterCard and Visa. However, you need to know that a prepaid debit card is not a credit card. First of all, the only money available to you is the money loaded on to the card. A credit card represents a loan. You are using someone else\u2019s money, and if you don\u2019t repay the debt, you are charged interest. With a prepaid debit card, a set amount of money is associated with the card. When you swipe it, your available funds are reduced. When all of the money associated with the card is depleted, you can no longer use the prepaid debit card. You have to reload the card if you want to use it again. With a prepaid debit card, you will likely pay fees. Many prepaid cards come with monthly fees.

This growing reliance on credit cards resulted in Americans closing out 2015 with more than $900 billion in credit card debt, according to a recent credit card study by CardHub. That means the average U.S. household is shouldering the highest amount of credit card debt \u2014 more than $8,000 per indebted household \u2014 since the Great Recession. It's a troubling (and disappointing) trend, especially when you consider just 18 months ago,many Americans reported either taking the scissors to their credit cards or making sure to pay off their balances in full each month. But more Americans seem to be practicing \"swipe now, worry later\" spending habits. \"Many consumers are focused on immediate gratification; it is very easy to pull out the plastic and make instant purchases,\" Laura Beal, a lecturer in finance, banking and real estate at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, told CardHub. In addition to factors like income and financial literacy, CardHub said where you live plays a significant role in how well you manage your credit card debt and how high that debt rises. Based on residents' average credit card balance and income, College Station, Texas, has the longest estimated payoff timeline at 387 months (more than 32 years), which is 47 times longer than the shortest payoff timeline, 10 months, for Cupertino, California.

The magnetic stripe, sometimes called swipe card or magstripe, is read by swiping past a magnetic reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards, and transportation tickets. They may also contain an RFID tag, a transponder device and/or a microchip mostly used for business premises access control or electronic payment. Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented in Denmark around 1900 for recording audio. In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960, IBM used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards, under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats.

Retailers in the United States mostly converted to chipped credit cards in October 2015 and slowly over the past 3 years we have all become accustomed to dipping credit cards at retail checkouts. So, why are we sometimes sliding cards the old-fashioned way rather than dipping (plugging the cards into the terminal) at some retailers? There are a couple issues behind whether a retailer has a chip-equipped terminal but still has you slide your card for payment. In addition to installing a new chip-ready terminal for checkout, the merchants must also install new software and then certify with their transaction processor that transactions are coming through accurately. Certification of their new process takes time and scheduling. Another reason for merchants\u2019 reluctance to adopt EMV is the additional time it takes to process a credit card transaction. While sliding a credit card takes only a few seconds, dipping the card into the card reader slot takes up to a minute longer because the transaction is verified in real-time. During non-rush months, an extra minute might be inconvenient but not noteworthy. However, during peak retail periods such as the winter holidays, every minute counts and retailers want those minutes spent shopping, not at the register.

This method proved to be unsecure and problematic, as it produced pages of sensitive credit card details. If someone misplaced or did not properly dispose of your credit card slip, a thief could use your carbon paper to steal information. As technology progressed, we moved away from carbon copies and shifted to magnetic strips. Up until the last decade, magnetic strips have been relatively safe and effective. Your credit card details are inside the strip and are transmitted to a computer or machine after swiped on a card reader. Unfortunately, as technology has progressed, so has criminal ingenuity.

EMV cards feature a built-in microprocessing chip that helps keep your information safe and secure. These types of cards are the standard throughout the world -- with the exception of the US. Chipped credit cards are still fairly new in the United States and have been slow to catch on. That\u2019s actually caused by a positive reason: fraud rates in the US are low compared to other countries. There was less incentive for banks (and cardholders) here to make the switch to EMV cards. Understanding How the Technology Works Chip-and-PIN authentication keeps credit cards secure in two ways. The chip itself allows the card to communicate with the card reader when you insert your plastic into the machine. The information on the chip is dynamic, which means it changes. It also interacts with the card reader to actively create and encrypt the information it shares with the machine. The chip in your card creates a unique transaction code every time you swipe it. This code is only valid for that one transaction. Even if this information is stolen, it\u2019s pretty useless -- using it again would cause a payment to be declined. The \u201cPIN\u201d part comes next. Once the chip communicates with the card reader and the system authorizes the transaction, you provide your PIN. If your PIN doesn\u2019t line up to the PIN required to use the card, the system won\u2019t authorize the transaction.

I have friends with RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cards, and they buy special sleeves to protect the cards while they are in their purses. But what happens when you have to pull it out to make a purchase? It turns out that even though new credit cards are issued with the RFID or \"Pay-Wave\" feature, you can opt out. I called CIBC today about my credit card, and after the operator made some inquiries, she confirmed that she could put in a request for my card to not have it. Even so, there was some sell of the feature: The operator emphasized that the Pay-Wave was for my convenience. It was faster, transactions would be limited to $50 or less (depending on the merchant), and in any case I could opt out of using the Pay Wave at all and demand to enter a PIN.

For many years the message to merchants from the payments industry has been clear: upgrading point-of-sale terminals to accept chip-enabled credit cards would substantially reduce the risk of card-present fraud. Yet concerns over the cost of hardware, retraining staff, and a rocky roll-out led many merchants to resist the change. A growing body of evidence shows that when it comes to card-present fraud, chip-enabled cards have largely delivered on their security promises. Merchants who have upgraded often see dramatic reductions in counterfeit card-present fraud. For merchants still on the sidelines who have yet to upgrade their POS terminals, it\u2019s time to take a fresh look at the issue.

The black stripe on the back is filled with data about your account, from the name of the card issuer to the limits on your card. This data is arranged on the stripe using tiny magnetic particles, so exposure to an external magnet can throw the information out of place and render the card unreadable. \"If you disturb the way that the particles were aligned in the first place by putting a magnet close to it, it will disrupt that encoding,\" says"}, {"title": " ", "text": "Japan Credit Bureau (JCB), jointly plan and implement EMV systems.

Currently, US consumers primarily rely on swipe-and-sign credit cards, which give card details to a merchant through the magnetic stripe on the back. But because the swipe-and-sign system became overburdened with instances of fraud, MasterCard, Visa, and other financial groups decided in 2012 that they would transition their systems to a chip-based setup called EMV (eponymous for EuroPay, MasterCard, and Visa, the three primary developers of the standard) by October 2015.

The magnetic stripe, sometimes called swipe card or magstripe, is read by swiping past a magnetic reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards, and transportation tickets. They may also contain an RFID tag, a transponder device and/or a microchip mostly used for business premises access control or electronic payment. Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented in Denmark around 1900 for recording audio. In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960, IBM used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards, under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions. Magnetic storage was known from World War II and computer data storage in the 1950s. In 1969 Forrest Parry, an IBM engineer, had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape, the predominant storage medium at the time, to a plastic card base."}, {"title": " ", "text": "in the UK for 18 years now, and both my husband and I have been the victim of credit card fraud.

And if you used plastic or disposable bags (rather than bags you brought on your own), you have to pay 5 cents per bag. The District passed a law requiring as much in 2009 -- a policy that states like New Jersey and New York are also considering, and that has been adopted around the world from Ireland and Scotland to South Africa. Some localities have gone farther still -- California and Hawaii have effectively banned plastic bags outright -- but recent research suggests that charges or fees can also be effective (and have the added benefit of being less coercive). Moreover, it suggests that they work, at least in part, through a surprising mechanism. It's not just the relatively minor added cost, on its own, that impels people to stop using plastic bags and to instead bring their own bags with them to the store. Rather, it's the way this small change disrupts habitual behaviors and helps people draw a tighter linkage between the environmental awareness that they already possess, and actions in the world that actually advance that consciousness and their values.

Flatten the tube, and you\u2019ve got two sheets of plastic on top of one another. Then stamp out the individual bags, seal the top and bottom, and cut out a rectangle for the handles. The cut, folded bag resembles a folded shirt, giving it the name \u201ct-shirt bag.\u201d The plastic itself is a mixture of high-density and low-density polyethylene. This is important: The high-density stuff is strong but brittle, and the low-density stuff is stretchy---extremely stretchy. If a shopping bag were made of low-density polyethylene, \u201cit would stretch to the ground before you got to the car,\u201d says Philip Rozenski, director of sustainability and marketing for Novolex, a maker of packaging products. After a plastic bag is cut, machines blast it with plasma, or superheated and charged air. This process, called a corona treatment, is why pulling one plastic bag off the grocery store rack slightly opens the next one---a tiny touch that adds a lot of convenience.

Though they seem small and light, plastic bags have a much larger environmental footprint than you may imagine, beginning with the energy required to make them. Twelve million barrels of oil are used to manufacture the plastic bags consumed in the United States each year, according to Waste Management Northwest. On a smaller scale, according to SPREP.org, you could drive a car a mile for the same amount of gasoline it takes to manufacture 14 plastic bags. The effects of plastic on the environment can be devastating. Plastic products such as plastic bags can take between 15 and 1,000 years to break down, and that\u2019s assuming they even make it into a landfill instead of winding up in water such as streams, rivers or the ocean \u2014 or floating around the neighborhood. Of the 100 billion plastic shopping bags Americans use each year, only about 1 percent are recycled, so a lot of plastic bag pollution is generated annually. Even where good intentions lead someone to recycle their plastic grocery bags, a lot of recycling equipment can\u2019t handle the task, according to a 2016 Business Insider article.

In 1977 plastic grocery bags were introduced as an alternative to paper. Since that time the bags have become much lighter and take up less space than ever before. Due to advances in technology, plastic bags have reduced their use of materials by 30 percent in the last five years alone. This was done without decreasing their strength. The reduction of materials is also a benefit when the bags end up in a landfill. Plastic bags are easily crushed by the trash on top of them and compress flat. Paper, on the other hand, does not flatten from the weight on top of it. As a result, plastic grocery bags generate 80 percent less solid weight than paper grocery bags. They also consume 40 percent less energy than paper to produce. In 1990 the first consumer plastic bag recycling programs became available. It is possible to recycle plastic bags at thousands of locations around the country. The bags are then turned into tiny pellets that are used to create new film products. Recycled plastic bags are made into products such as trash can liners, plastic lumber, drain pipes, and even new bags. Use as small trash bags in the bedroom or the office.

Jared Blumenfeld, director of the San Francisco Environment Department, says some grocery stores already provide recycling bins for used plastic bags and give shoppers a credit if they tote their own bags. \"At the moment, the incentive hasn't moved the market,\" he says. That could be because the credit isn't big enough or well advertised. Safeway, for example, gives shoppers who bring their own bags 1 cent for plastic and 3 cents for paper.

It's that simple. Plastic bags come in two basic types: thick bags used for clothes, CD's, electrical appliances and other goods, and thin bags used by supermarkets and take-away food stores. The story of plastic bags begins with the mining of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas. The by-product of fossil fuel production is ethylene, a carbon-hydrogen compound. Ethylene is then turned into polyethylene, a long chain carbo-hydrogen molecule whose atoms are tightly bound together. It's the tightness of the bonds that make plastic so indestructible. Polyethylene is made into plastic pellets, which are then used to make plastic bags. Recycling cuts out part of this process. To recycle plastic from supermarket or checkout bags, bags are shredded and then heated and re-extruded into plastic pellets. These pellets can be used in the manufacture of pipes, bags, film, bins, ducts, bottles, building, marine, automotive parts and more bags. Bags going to recycling need to be clean and empty. Any bags containing food scraps or shopping dockets will just be thrown away adding to the time and resources needed for recycling. Thicker shopping bags, such as bags from clothing, appliances and record stores, can't be recycled; adding these to the collection just contaminates the batch being sent for recycling. \u2022 Clean out any food scraps or dockets from your plastic bags.

Paper bags avoid some of the pitfalls of plastic bags because paper bags can be recycled and take less time to decompose if they don\u2019t make it to a landfill.

Until somebody recycles them, that is. They can be made into, among other things, robust furniture. I\u2019m sure that major stores have discovered efficiencies in delivering paper bags. But paper is bulkier than plastic, probably by something like 10 times. Paper bags, then, require from 10-15 times more fuel to transport, and roughly 10 times as much storage space as plastic. The transport and storage are not just one way. The customer will take these bags home, and most will end in the trash or recycling bin. It costs 10-15 times as much to haul away the paper as plastic. Plus, for those bags that aren\u2019t recycled, the space on the garbage trucks isn\u2019t insignificant. Nor is it on the recycling truck. In other words, a lot of fuel is burned up carting paper bags to and fro. Plus, much space is taken; space at the store which is heated, air conditioned, kept dry. This is fuel and space that could have been saved had plastic bags been used. Plastic, made from natural gas which we have in abundance, eventually sits in the landfill\u2014and sits, and sits. But that\u2019s all it does: sits. And sits in a trash heap, a place set aside for rubbish. Meaning, of course, that it can be avoided.

While now ubiquitous, the plastic bag has a relatively short history. Invented in Sweden in 1962, the single-use plastic shopping bag was first popularized by Mobil Oil in the 1970s in an attempt to increase its market for polyethylene, a fossil-fuel-derived compound. Many American customers disliked the plastic bag when it was introduced in 1976, disgusted by the checkout clerks having to lick their fingers when pulling the bags from the rack and infuriated when a bag full of groceries would break or spill over.

Why not offer plastic bags, but charge for them instead? The goal of this ordinance is to reduce overall plastic bag use. As illustrated in other communities who have passed similar ordinances, bans are better than fees at helping us reach this goal. California law (AB2449) prohibited charging for plastic bags, however it didn\u2019t prohibit charging for paper bags. As a result, retailers are able to recover their cost for providing paper bags, and this small fee helps encourages customers to use reusable bags, thus also reducing the use of paper bags. 12.

The primers on these paper hull shotgun shells also changed from the pistol primers used on the early brass shotgun shells to a primer containing both the priming charge and an anvil, unlike rifle and pistol ammunition, making the shotgun shell primer taller. Card wads, made of felt and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various times, gradually giving way to plastic over powder wads, with card wads, and, eventually, to all plastic wads.

Typical construction Modern shotgun shells typically consist of a plastic hull, with the base covered in a thin brass or plated steel covering. As noted previously, paper shells used to be common, and are still made, as are solid brass shells. Some companies have produced what appear to be all-plastic shells, although in these there is a small metal ring cast into the rim of the shell to provide strength. Often the more powerful loads will use \"high brass\" shells, with the brass extended up further along the sides of the shell, while light loads will use \"low brass\" shells.

For many, especially young people, the opposite is true. They are so unaccustomed to using cash that when they have hard currency it burns a hole in their pocket. They view it as extra and spend it quickly. Meanwhile, they don\u2019t keep a bulging George Costanza billfold full of receipts; by relying on plastic they can more easily track all their spending through monthly statements or a service like Mint.com.

All cards are subject to what are called interchange or transaction fees. These fees are the \"cost\" of transferring funds between the merchant bank and the customer's bank (card issuer). Companies like Visa determine these fees, which often involve a fixed and variable component. For example, the interchange fee might be $0.25 per transaction plus 2% of the purchase price. Generally, merchants prefer their customers use debit cards. That's because the interchange fees are usually lower than credit cards. The higher interchange fees associated with credit cards allow financial institutions to profitably market offers such as 1% cash back rewards.

Before discussing when you need to sign for a credit card purchase and when you don\u2019t, let\u2019s review the reasons you sign for plastic transactions in the first place. The first is identity verification. One of the reasons you\u2019re required to sign the back of your credit card is so that merchants can check the signature on your card to the signature on your receipt. If they don\u2019t match, this is one way to catch a credit card thief. Of course, it\u2019s pretty rare that a store clerk will actually take this step, but it could theoretically happen. The second is to protect all parties involved (you, the merchant, and the credit card company) in the event that a purchase is disputed. For example, if you spot a transaction your credit card statement that you didn\u2019t make, the credit card company can demand a signed receipt from the merchant to prove you it was you who swiped the card. If he can\u2019t, your case is bolstered. But alternatively, if he can, he\u2019s protected from having to refund the cash.

Undeniably there are some disadvantages of credit cards especially when people cannot repay the amount they have already spent or when they are hacked. However, this cannot degrade the usefulness of plastic money in the modern era. Banks should never grant credit cards to people with bad credit records or to someone who does not have an economic stability to actually afford it. In fact, the credit limit imposed on every credit card actually does restrain people from being extravagant and become a bad creditor.

Before you start charging ahead, here's a look at some of the best ways to pay for different items on your list this winter: Plastic is especially useful here because pricey (and often prone to defects) consumer electronics have high rates of return. Using a card generates another paper trail in case you lose your receipt, or if a retailer is unwilling to take a return. Also, keep in mind: Fees: When you're making a purchase, ask about restocking fees charged by some stores for giving refunds and whether the seller allows returns on merchandise that's been opened or defective. If you can, get policies in writing. Perks: Card issuers such as Visa and MasterCard may offer extended protection for disputes with merchants.

The plastic in this case is of the credit card variety, and the question relates to whether using a card rather than cash affects how much you spend. Some believe that simply using plastic for transactions makes us spend more, because it changes how our brains work -- or, at least, how we think -- when we're making purchases. However, their case is far from conclusive. A couple of years ago, IndexCreditCards.com reviewed some of the academic research that's tried to explore the supposed link between credit card use and greater spending. It's undeniable that a number of studies suggest such a link, and at least one (\"Do Payment Mechanisms Change the Way Consumers Perceive Products?\" from the Journal of Consumer Research) found that people who made purchases using plastic might tend to focus more on a product's benefits, while those paying cash tend to focus more on its cost. However, the problem with many of these studies was highlighted in another paper, published in 2009 by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University: It's easy to show a correlation between card use and higher spending, but much harder to demonstrate causation. In other words, it may be that the sorts of people who use plastic are the sorts of people who tend to spend more. They prioritize benefits over costs because that's"}, {"title": " ", "text": "it\u2019s your credit score or your savings account, by confronting what you\u2019ve been afraid to know or deal with, you put the power to take control back in your own hands.

Of all the choices you make at the checkout counter, the decision to pay with a credit card has the biggest impact on your bottom line. Multiple studies, including this 2008 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, have found consumers are willing to spend more when they pay with a credit card instead of cash. \"Credit cards allow consumers to focus more on what they&apos;re getting, or buying, than what they&apos;re losing, or spending,\" explains Kit Yarrow, a professor of psychology and marketing at Golden Gate University.

It seems like common sense to anyone who has ever made the jump from paper cash to plastic cards, but when we swipe, we tend to spend more. An MIT study proves it.

Your card stays intact and looking good. Therefore, it is more likely to be kept and used. The other benefit of plastic business cards is that they make a very positive impression on people.

You start with a standard wafer, build up your circuit on one side, and then remove the back side of the wafer mechanically until you achieve a thickness of less than 25 microns. (The technology for making wafers thinner has been well developed for MEMS sensors and related products.) At this thickness, it is possible to bend silicon easily. Why would you want to? Apparently, the makers of smart cards are looking at this. Many of you in the United States may not be aware that most credit cards in the rest of the world have an integrated chip, and, instead of swiping a magnetic strip through a reader, a transaction involves a conversation between a card reader, the card, and the card user.

This comes as a relief for vendors that specialize in small purchase items like coffee shops that have weathered the unintended consequences of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which capped debit swipe fees at 21 cents. Previously, merchants would pay a small percentage of the total cost in swipe fees where a $1 cup of coffee would incur a transaction fee of a few cents.

Well, it\u2019s not \u2018just a piece of plastic\u2019; it\u2019s a very powerful piece of plastic which can be regarded as a compressed form of cash. We can define credit cards as a credit system that allows the consumer to borrow money on the fly from a bank or a financial institution and use it to make payments to the merchants. In order to obtain a credit card, the consumer needs to fill-in an application form that is actually like an agreement between the credit card supplier and the credit card consumer. The credit card supplier approves the application form and provides the consumer with a small piece of plastic (i.e. the credit card). This plastic (or credit card) contains electronically encoded security information in the form of a magnetic strip (which is generally located at the back of the credit card). This information is used for authorising payments whenever the consumer uses the credit card. The consumer can use the credit card for shopping at merchant outlets or on the internet etc. Of course, this is subject to merchant\u2019s capability to accept credit card payments. Accepting the credit cards is, however, not enough. The merchant should be able to accept payments made through the credit card provided by that credit card organization (of which you hold the credit card) i.e. VISA, MasterCard etc. You can also use credit card to withdraw cash from ATMs (automatic cash machines) also"}, {"title": " ", "text": "A credit card is a type of payment card issued by a bank or another financial institution that provides the holder with different financial services. It consists of a plastic card of standard size that shows the name of the holder, his signature, a number, expiration date, a magnetic stripe and a microchip. Unlike other bank cards, the amount is deducted from the bank account after the purchase is made.The transaction involves three parties: the card-issuer, or the institution that issues the card and receives a commission on each payment, the merchant, or the business adhering to the circuit, and the cardholder, who commits to return to the issuer the amount as indicated the contract. The use of credit cards is beneficial both for the customer, who can make purchases quickly and without the use of cash, and for the supplier, who is not subjected to the risk of a payment by check. In addition to to make payments, the credit card can be used to withdraw cash by entering a secret code. The first credit card was introduced in 1950 in the US by the Diners Club to buy products and services related tourism, food and entertainment. This card allowed members to pay for the purchased services even after two months.

Another advantage is the ability to assign specific types of payment to specific lines of credit. For example, charging emergency uses, such as healthcare expenses, to one of the magnetic stripes and personal uses to the other magnetic stripe. These are merely exemplary of advantages that the credit card, according to the present invention, provides to the credit card user. With respect to credit card banks, credit card banks which distribute transaction cards, such as the cards 20 and 40, have the advantage of garnering additional market share by replacing at least one other transaction card in the user's array to thereby become a card of choice. In addition, business/personal card synergies are achievable, benefitting both users and credit card banks. For example, a strong corporate card can add all of its business customers to its personal card portfolio by providing a combination business/personal card (and vice-versa). Such an advantage is even more compelling when card rebates, such as airline miles, are consolidated for both accounts on a card. Deployment of credit cards, such as the credit cards 20 and 40, is relatively easy to implement because the cards themselves are relatively inexpensive to produce since it is less expensive to manufacture single credit cards with dual stripes than to manufacture two separate one-stripe cards.

Other types of companies liked that baked-in loyalty as well, creating their own credit card variations and adding new features along the way. Transportation companies also got in the act. Early gas stations in the 1920s started offering cards of their own, taking advantage of the fact that travelers and commuters need to keep fueling up. Companies like Texaco, in producing their cards, decided upon a slightly better format than the department store dog tags: playing-card-sized pieces of paper. That helped to set a standard size for payment cards. The airline industry proved to be a major innovator in the credit realm. In 1936, American Airlines started issuing the Air Travel Card,which is generally considered the first \u201ccharge card\u201d in history.

Loose change was a pain to carry around, especially for large purchases. Just like nowadays, it\u2019s dangerous to walk around with a lot of money in your pockets ahead of a big purchase. Eventually, credit cards came about as a way to solve the issue. The original credit cards came from department stores in the early 20th century, handing out metal coins or charge plates to track a user\u2019s spending against their credit at the store. The coins were imprinted using ink to track the amount spent on a sheet of paper, along with the person\u2019s address.

Fraudulent transaction detection is a big issue in the credit card domain because the data set is highly imbalanced. The performance of traditional classification techniques has decreased due to this issue. Therefore, a dynamic fraud detection system is required to overcome this issue. This article proposes an efficient cost\u2010sensitive weak learner approach with a bagging and random forest classifier (CSWLB) to minimize misclassification problems and overcome the class imbalance issue. The proposed CSWLB approach is included in an adaptive algorithmic method (cost\u2010sensitive) with two weak learner ensembles (bagging\u2010random forest), which assigns high weight to the fraudulent transactions using the cost\u2010sensitive learning classifier and generates weight bags using a bagging ensemble classifier. Therefore, the random forest classifier has been implemented on the weight bags to improve classification accuracy. The proposed approach's effectiveness and efficiency have been computed on the Brazilian credit card data set. Its results have been compared with sampling, cost\u2010sensitive, and machine learning techniques. The proposed CSWLB approach obtained 765 total costs and 97.361% accuracy.

By Cam Merritt Reviewed by: Ashley Donohoe, MBA When You Swipe Your Credit Card, Does it Take Just the Numbers? For the vast majority of people in the vast majority of situations, a debit card marked with \"Electronic Use Only\" is going to behave just like any other debit card. The phrase serves as a reminder of a time when card transactions weren't simple or quick \u2013 a time that card issuers would like to put behind them. When your debit card says \"Electronic Use Only\" on it, this means merchants must use on-the-spot authorization with it. What \"Electronic Use Only\" Means The little machine you swipe your debit card through at the store has a name: a processing terminal. There's some high-tech hocus-pocus involved, but essentially, when you swipe your card, the terminal contacts whatever institution issued the card. The bank verifies the debit card is valid, checks that your account has money in it, and instantly authorizes the transaction. If your debit card says \"Electronic Use Only,\" it means any transaction involving the card must receive this kind of on-the-spot authorization. Perhaps surprisingly to those accustomed to swipe-and-go sales, not all debit and credit card transactions are subject to on-the-spot validation and authorization.

Read through the article to know more about the intricacies involving this little but widely used plastic card. A credit card is issued by a financial institution, usually a bank, to an individual. The issuing authority, in effect, assures the individual that it will lend him a certain amount of money (equal to the card limit) to pay for his purchases. All credit cards follow a standard size called ID-1, as defined under ISO/IEC 7810, which is 85.60 x 53.98 mm. A credit card is very different from a debit card, because in such a transaction, money is not taken out of the cardholder's bank account. It is simply reduced from the total amount that can be lent by the bank (which is the credit limit). Interest is charged on the total amount spent by the cardholder as per a 'revolving credit' method. The individual can then choose to either repay the entire amount due or pay a minimum amount, every billing cycle. The terms and conditions, including the method of calculating the minimum amount due and the rate of interest, the amount of days after which the interest will be charged, etc. are mentioned in the contract or agreement between the individual and the card issuer. The cardholder provides his card to the merchant who swipes it on a payment terminal or a point-of-sale.

Almost 50 percent of credit card purchases and authorizations are made by telephone, e-mail, and regular mail without a signature. Of these charges, 5 percent are disputed and, despite the fact that the cardholder originally authorized the charge, reversed because the card was not swiped at the time of the charge. If a dispute is investigated and the merchant does not have an imprinted sales draft and adequate invoices to support the charge, it will inevitably be resolved in favor of the cardholder. It is therefore recommended that, in order to substantiate the loan agreement, the credit card be swiped and the sales draft be retained in case it is needed at a later date. It is recommended that the client be called and reminded that the proofs were to have been returned and that they are now past due. This means that at the time the client signs the agreement, you will make an imprint of the card used to support the loan agreement and advise the cardholder that no charge will be made to the card unless the terms of the agreement are not upheld.

Nayax makes a nice card reader that works with cards (swip), cards (chip and pin), cards (rfid), phones (NFC) and loyalty cards (NFC). I've figured out how to wire the readers for my self-serve wash bay. I've found two options. 1) The reader sends eletronic pulses through my coin mechanism to my timer. Each pulse represents $.25 and provides 25 seconds of time. I can only set up one charge in this manner, so if a customer swips for$5 that is all they get. When the time ends they have to swipe again. 2? I added a wire to a pin on the timer cable. When a card is swiped the connection is closed which turns the timer on and start to count up time.

The device promised to digitally hold eight credit or debit cards and let you choose between them at will. You could swipe Coin in any conventional card reader, and it would notify you if it had been lost or stolen using Bluetooth. Coin would have a two-year battery life, and a companion app that could hold your coupons and ID cards. But Coin still hasn\u2019t shipped.

It lets you swipe between 20 cards or barcodes using an E-ink touchscreen, and offers NFC (like the iPhone 6) for contactless transactions, an EMV \"chip\" for the latest card readers, and RFID so you can replace your office building\u2019s ID card. Even if you don\u2019t know all the acronyms by heart, Plastc already sounds impressive. But there\u2019s more.

Once you've confirmed your identity, you'll be able to add your \"old school\" cards to the smart card's app by swiping them through the card reader. Using Bluetooth, the app loads the information onto your smart credit card. How can one magnetic stripe act as many different cards? Like this: When you select the card you want to use, an induction coil embedded within the card sends a signal that re-programs the magnetic strip. They're just like any other credit card, so you should be able to use them everywhere. Most of the credit cards in your wallet are actually equipped with two magnetic stripes, called \"Track 1\" and \"Track 2.\" You can't see them. They are usually masked under what looks like a single stripe. Track 1 is primarily used for your name, while Track 2 is used for your credit card number.

Instead of swiping a credit card, users of the service will swipe their iPhones (or Apple Watches), which can be preloaded with customer\u2019s debit and credit cards using the Passbook application. Having one phone to rule all our cards sounds pretty great, and Apple is certainly positioned better than any other company to make mobile payments finally catch on. But there\u2019s one issue the company still has to surmount before it can kill off plastic for good: Right now, the vast majority of retailers lack the technology to accept the company\u2019s new payment service.

The remaining 97.6% of businesses do not have point-of-sale systems that work with near-field communication (NFC), the technology Apple Pay relies on.

EMV stands for Europay Mastercard and Visa and is a relatively new standard for securing debit and credit card transactions. Already in the last several years new payment processors have emerged to address the needs of small businesses. But the eventuality of chip and pin cards and the dissolution of swipe and sign is bringing some new competitors to the forefront.

Usable area The card is usable for the following operators' lines: Tosaden K\u014dts\u016b tram and bus lines (including former Tosaden, Tosaden Dream Service and K\u014dchiken K\u014dts\u016b bus lines) bus lines bus lines, between Susaki and Suginokawa or Yusuhara The card also functions as an electronic money. Types of cards Corresponding different ages, the card is classified into the three different \"colors\": Orange Card: For elementary school students, usable until April 1 of 12 years old. Green Card: For 12 years old and older. Purple Card: For 65 years old and older. Corresponding functions, the three cards are each classified into three, making the nine different cards in total: Unregistered card Registered card: Needs registration.

I know this because I was one of them, and when I lived in Berkeley, there was one experience that drew out all of the stereotypes I had in me: Riding on Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART. Twitter data scientist Asif Haque has had his BART frustrations, too. Thus, he decided to take a data-driven approach to see if its fares were \u201cfair\u201d or not. In the process, he also devised a system to help riders artificially lower the cost of riding on public transportation by switching cards with fellow passengers in mid-ride. For those unfamiliar, BART\u2019s swiping and pricing system works like this: A passenger puts money on a paper ticket or plastic Clipper card, swipes through a turnstile at the origin stop, then swipes through another turnstile at the destination. How much you\u2019re charged depends on where you eventually exit, and not necessarily how many stops you travel. (It\u2019s a mileage-based formula, plus certain taxes here and there.)

Now, the really nice thing about this card is the integration of this card with the rest of Taiwan. You can use it at any 7-11/corner store (these are everywhere -- often multiple on a single block). It's also getting integrated into apartments. Meaning your subway card can get you around town, buy food, and open your house door.

Bonus -- Taiwan also has a bunch of public bike racks around town that you can check out and ride around. It's free for the first 30 minutes, and there's a corresponding app that tells you where they are, where you can park, etc. And to check a bike out, you just need to use your subway card. ![taiwanbike](/images/taiwan-bike.jpg) **Self Serve Culture** Outside of transportation, one of the major differences that I noticed between Taiwan and America was an inherent culture of self serve.

MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table 4, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the informa- tion, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \"why would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \"what is your name?\" while MISSA was able to generate the response \"why can't you use my address?\", which is consistent to the context.

Barnhart and Allan A. Metcalf in their book \u201cAmerica in So Many Words.\u201d \u201cWhen it is used to mean \u2018to explode or fall apart or be arrested,\u2019 bust is generally slang. In the sense of failing (especially financially) it is informal, as busting the bank in gambling lingo, while in the specialized sense of taming a horse it is standard, the only way to say busting a bronco.\u201d Despite its potential slanginess, busted is \u201cnot actually forbidden\u201d in the news media, as the Boston Globe language columnist Jan Freeman wrote in August. Indeed, reporters often latch onto the occasional colloquialism that seems particularly expressive, and in this case, Freeman surmises they were drawn to the term\u2019s \u201ccriminal-cowboy-macho connotations.\u201d Regardless of the reasons for its current vogue, it\u2019s notable that busted was rarely relied on by the press to describe stricken oil wells before the BP disaster \u2014 even in incidents that were highly similar, such as the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc I well in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the precursors I found come from more literary sources. It was appropriate, for instance, in some light verse by J.W. Foley published in The New York Times in 1904: Dear friend, there\u2019s a question I\u2019d like to ask you, (Your pardon I crave if it vexes) Have you ever invested a hundred or two In an oil well somewhere down"}, {"title": " ", "text": "Wood on Words: Using the wrong word?

Bust a Bronco Meaning Definition: To tame a wild horse; to train a wild horse to be ridden. Origin of Bust a Bronco This expression first appeared in the late 1800s and comes from the American frontier. Bust comes from burst, which is a synonym for break. Breaking horses is another expression with the same meaning. Cowboys or other people living in the country would use this expression when training horses. They likely used this expression because training horses traditionally has involved breaking their spirit by trying to dominate them. If the horse fears humans, it will be more likely to allow them to ride it. Examples of Bust a Bronco In this example, two sisters talk about their upcoming vacation to a ranch in Colorado. Amy: I can\u2019t believe our parents are making us go to this ranch. Kimberly: Really? I\u2019m super excited for it! Amy: No way. You mean you want to throw lassos and bust a bronco? Kimberly: No, but I do want to ride some horses and experience the great outdoors! Try to be more open-minded. You might like it. Amy: I\u2019m just not a fan of the Wild West. Kimberly: Well, it\u2019s not that wild these days. In the second example, two friends are discussing a third friend. Keira: Hey! What do you know about Ben? Rory: Not much.

A: I would have thought that it has its origins in the law enforcement term '[To carry out a drug] bust'. Although it is often used interchangeably with the term raid, I would suggest that the physical act of gaining forced entry by \"busting the door down\" led to its becoming known as such. A: Green's Slang Dictionary has bust meaning a break in or a raid dating from 1865, but the earliest reference to a police raid is from 1938. Later the word came to mean any arrest or criminal charge. This usage probably derives from burst meaning a burglary, which it dates from 1834. I can recall Philip K. Dick using the word burst as a typically Dickian substitution for bust in one of his novels (sadly I forget which one), which would have required commendable self-discipline in the days before word processors. A: Etymonline tends to back up MrHen's guess: variant of burst, 1764, Amer.Eng. The verb sense of [...] \"arrest\" is from 1953 (earlier \"to raid\" from Prohibition).

Later in the episode, both Michaels and Triple H (separately) proceeded to the ring for the Bret Hart-Triple H match, each of them directing the slogan and crotch-chops at fans seated along the entry ramp, as well as the viewers watching at home. The slogan is also used in the D-X Army's popular \"Let's get ready to suck it!\" promos, conceived as a parody of Michael Buffer's \"Let's get ready to rumble!\" match introduction that was routinely featured at televised WCW"}, {"title": " ", "text": "Busta Rhymes the great / We 'bout to rip the Tri-State, yo, yo / Hey hey hey!

Most scholars consider the title a respectful one, but less adoring than the term adonai. By contrast, when Thomas later accepts the truth of the resurrection he calls Jesus \"My lord and my God\" (John 20:28). Mary's reaction seems to be spontaneous, and it is not known if \"Rabboni\" is an exclamation of discovery, or whether it should read \"Rabboni?\" with Mary momentarily questioning Jesus. The Greek word \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 in the original text and its Latin translation magister mean \"teacher\". Older English translations use \"master\", derived from the Latin word and meaning the same thing. Context Mary has found Jesus' tomb empty and is worrying about what happened to his body. At first she does not recognize Jesus when he appears, thinking he is a gardener. In John 20:16 she recognizes him when he calls her by name. John 20:14 has already mentioned that Mary had turned around to see Jesus, so why does this verse say she turns again? One school of thought is that unmentioned by the author Mary had turned away from Jesus in the meantime. Kastner argues that she did so because the resurrected Jesus was nude. According to Brown most scholars simply believe that she had not fully turned in John"}, {"title": " ", "text": "est une compilation de trois CD qui comprend les cinq albums des Ramones sur Chrysalis Records : Brain Drain, Mondo Bizarro, Acid Eaters, \u00a1Adios Amigos! et Loco Live (certaines versions incluent Animal Boy de Loco Live).

Antisthenes is proud of his wealth although we learn from Hermogenes' question that Antisthenes actually has little money or land, which fact he jokes about (3.8). His answer seems paradoxical. Charmides, on the other hand, prides himself on his poverty. Socrates praises this notion, because poverty does not cause envy, it is safe without being guarded, and it grows when neglected (3.9). Next Kallias asks Socrates on what he prides himself. His answer, like his comments in sections2.16-2.19, is in jest (Huss reference). He says that he prides himself on match-making. Everyone laughs at his boast, and Socrates continues his jest saying that he could make a lot of money through the trade (3.10). This funny exchange leads Lykon to say that Philippos' pride must lie in jesting. When asked by Antisthenes, Lykon says that he is most proud of his son, Autolykos. At this someone remarked that the boy was obviously proud of his victory in the pankration, but Autolykos denies this claiming instead to be most proud of his father (3.13). Kallias then addressed Lykon saying that he was the richest man in the world, a fact which Lykon admits.

How can I, a sinner, purge my guilt?\" Nietzsche responds by saying that, in fact, \"There is no necessary objection between sensuality and chastity.\" Sensuality and chastity can coexist in the human experience, and when there is a conflict, it does not need to be tragic. Nietzsche suggests that there are some \"mortals\", who find balancing their existence between two extremes, angel and animal, to be an attraction to life itself. It is easy to understand that those who are \"brought to the point of adoring chastity\" will be obsessed with its opposite, and will adore that. Nietzsche metaphorically refers to such people as \"animals of Circe\". Circe is a sorceress in the legends of ancient Greece who had the power to turn humans into lions, wolves and swine.

The example of Darius the Mede illustrates that when facing arguments against the historical veracity of the biblical text, the religious reader has strategies at his disposal, including both reexamination of extrabiblical data and occasional use of exegetical traditions in the classical rabbinic literature that reconstruct the meaning of the biblical text and are surprisingly similar to conclusions presented in scholarly literature. Conclusion Methods of confronting difficulties within the biblical text have been developed throughout the generations, and remain effective today. They include linguistic analysis and the use of exegetical traditions that address similar challenges. Moreover, the method of critiquing the critique-that is, reexamining and reinterpretating extrabiblical findings-should produce effective results in confronting these challenges.

I agree with this assessment but I would use the same phrase as justification for most of my complaints about the impact of using Clojure without a lot of discipline. Most of the pain I've felt on the larger evolving Clojure/Clojurescript codebases I've worked on comes down to one thing, holding a mental model of the system in my head. All codebases require a developer to build, maintain and persist a mental model of the system in her head. This mental model is the reason that context switching is so harmful to software development productivity. If you're a developer you will have experienced someone asking you a question or insisting you attend a meeting right when you're in the middle of a problem and you dropping that mental model on the floor. It can take many minutes or even an hour or more to re-assemble this mental model to the same point so you can continue your work. ### Why mental models matter? ### Why does supporting the building a mental model matter?

What's going on? `slice()` returns a copy of an array. This is awesome! But there's this weird line in the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) docs that says slice 'returns a shallow copy'. The [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/tkcsy6fe(v=vs.94).aspx) and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_array.asp) docs don't mention this at all, so what in the world does this mean? Let's think back for a moment to [how variables work](http://prestonparry.com/articles/VariableNamesAsLinks/). They're basically just links to some other place on the hard drive where the actual data is stored. ##What hapens if there are variables in my array? What slice does is copy over the variable, not the data that variable points to. Say you make a change to the object a variable is pointing to. The 'copied' array will still include a variable pointing to that same object, which has now been changed. **Slice copies over variables as pointers, and does not create a copy of the data each variable points to.** ##How to create a 'deep' copy Creating a 'deep' copy means your new copy will have no linkages to the original object. The easiest to create a deep copy by far is to use JSON. {% highlight css linenos=table %} var mySuperNestedArr = [myFavoriteSuperHeroesArr,myFavoriteCatGifsObj,taySwiftsEntireCatalogueObj]; var completelySeparateCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mySuperNestedArr)); {% endhighlight %} When you JSON.stringify a variable, it creates a whole new object.

What is a float? An integer is a whole number, without a decimal. A float is number with a decimal. ## What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? Integers are whole numbers. When dealing with integer division, the computer only sees integers and can only produce an integer. That means the computer can only return the integer value. This becomes a problem if you are dividing two numbers, say 3 and 2, that cannot result in an integer. In this case, the computer returns the nearest integer rounded down. For 3 / 2, that would be 1. For float division, the computer would see 3.0 and 2.0. The computer now understands past that decimal point! That means, when the computer divides 3.0 / 2.0, it can include the 5 for 1.5. ## Calculate the number of hours in a year ``` valueNotEntered = true; while valueNotEntered do puts \"Is it a leap year?

As a creator, who are you creating for? Who do you want to help with your work? What group of individuals in your life are the most important to you?

They say you never really know how much something means to you until someone takes it away. Similarly, some people never learn how to live until they lose their life. It is amazing the things which we keep bottled inside, afraid to show anyone, little things that tear our emotions to shreds, just because we can't let go of them; such as anger, hurt, and fear. And what do we do, if we have lived our entire life like this, and suddenly found that our life is about to end, and we are not really sure of what is important, and whether all that we have done was right, or wrong.

She responded by telling me her own story, of being forced to become the second wife of Obaldo, an older man: 'When I arrived at the Agency [local government office] my whole family was there, as well as the authorities, Obaldo and his wife. They told me that I had gone with Obaldo to the field after the dance, and that because of this we had to end the relationship or they would make us marry. Because I was a minor I didn't have the right to say anything [at the meeting]. I began to cry and said I had done nothing, and wanted nothing to do with Obaldo. Then my uncle spoke and said that since I had no parents, someone needed to be responsible for me, and if I had done what these people were saying, then I should marry Obaldo. Anyway, no-one in the family could support me financially, and since this man was offering to do it, then it would be best if I went with him.'

Menstruating women have been viewed differently for a long period of time and the taboo with this issue is also quite generalized. It was often seen as an issue with a woman's bodily functions and many women were also forbidden to enter holy sacred places of different religions due to seeing menstruation as a negative means of a woman's body. Christ has also spoken of how a Goddess is also a representation to a birthgiver which is where women are privileged and it's a life-giving power that women carry.

For instance, in writing, to combine the horror genre with a western or hard-boiled detective story with science fiction. In music, the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification. The sound of the term calls to mind other uses of \"buster\" such as \"crime buster\", \"Gangbusters\", \"Ghostbusters\", \"Dambusters\", etc. Creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category. So genre-busting within the publishing world has become a type of literary fiction.

Ah, the magic of phrasal verbs. To a non-native English speaker, \u201cto chop down\u201d and \u201cto chop up\u201d seem like they would be direct opposites (and might inspire some interesting mental images). Those who really know the language are aware that chopping something down means to hack at it until it falls, while chopping it up means to cut it into smaller pieces. 19.

I mentioned the term to my 91 year-old father. Yes, it was once widely used; and yes, it meant in no time at all. I have vague memories as a very young kind of waving around a wilted flower stem, or perhaps a stick of rhubarb, and pretending I was doing a couple of shakes of a dead lamb's dangly bit.

And from this comes the much more widely used 'two shakes' - as in \"I'll be with you in two shakes\". Where did it come from? Well, the online dictionaries variously suggest an American or Antipodean origin - though one points to an earlier Yorkshire (that's where I grew up) or Welsh origin.

Even if you\u2019ve never heard the term idiom, you have most likely heard many other idiomatic expressions. Here are just a few of the most common idioms used today: You\u2019re in hot water. His boss gave him the ax. It\u2019s time to face the music. You\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. If you took the first example literally, you\u2019d think it was describing a person standing in a bathtub full of hot water, perhaps. But the expression is actually used to describe a person who\u2019s in trouble. Likewise, rather than literally being handed a tool for chopping wood, if you get the ax from your boss, it means you\u2019re getting fired. It\u2019s time to face the music means that it\u2019s time to come to terms with the consequences of your actions.

Given the strong anti-Japanese sentiment that still exists among many Chinese after what happened in the last World War, we conveniently omitted this fact when Jack asked us where the game came from. The rules are simple. There are three words which are yelled out: Ar, Saw and Chor. Each word is associated with a hand action. Ar is said with the right hand being brought down once in a karate chopping motion. Saw is the same, but with the left hand. Chor is said with both hands being brought down. Whenever you make the chopping action, you point to another person, and their job is to continue the sequence.

If you don't want to hurt someone, take steps to make sure you don't. Am I oversimplifying? I just need space - This means they've already found an alternate space (away from you) and just need you to be aware of it.

But, it's equally destructive if you are the person (like me) who takes almost everything seriously.

In a similar vein, one year later, Marshall Sahlins wrote \"Rich Man, Poor Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in Polynesia and Melanesia\" (1963). Sahlins made the case that political leadership in Melanesia did not involve anything like a chief ruling over a chiefdom, a polity that was imagined for Polynesia and for Africa.

I suppose that every writer--except for the really bad ones, except for the truly incompetent ones--knows what he's doing; but someone with a great deal of talent or someone with genius knows more than other writers.

The first such solution, suggested to me by Andreas Albertsen, depends on a particular interpretation of the core luck egalitarian commitment. I have presented luck egalitarianism as saying that whatever results from the properly situated exercise of choice is not thereby unjust. However, Albertsen suggests understanding the luck egalitarian commitment as saying that 'our relative position should reflect our exercise of responsibility'. This would mean that at some point, a luck egalitarian could insist that an individual's position is no longer proportionate to their exercise of responsibility. My view is that this is not what most luck egalitarians mean and is anyway not an attractive solution.

The laboring body does not know distinctness because its cyclic process is the same for everyone. However, the way we appear before others in public is distinct.

[I am not in front of my body, I am in it, or rather, I am it]\" (Merleau-Ponty, 2010: 834). When Merleau-Ponty explained that 'I am my body,' it means, from an Arendtian perspective, that our distinctness is necessarily embodied. Furthermore, it refers to the distinction I have made between the body as an object and embodiment. When the body is taken as an object, its appearance is submitted to a model of analysis. In other words, I already or instantly know what this object/body is. However, if a phenomenon is embodied and appears in public, then, this embodiment is a disclosure that is yet to be discovered or understood.

Speech acts One of Clark's better-known studies was on how to make requests that overcome an obstacle to compliance. In making requests, speakers analyze the greatest potential obstacle they see to getting the information that they want, and frame their requests in a way that overcomes them in the easiest manner possible. They can frame the request in 3 different ways: to design an indirect request conditional on the absence or elimination of the obstacle, to make broadly applicable conditional requests, or to approach an obstacle sideways. For example, if a speaker wants to know the time of the concert he is attending with his friend, he knows his friend may not remember. He will therefore make an indirect request conditional on the elimination of the obstacle and ask, \u201cDo you remember what time the concert is tonight?\u201d which will mean \u201cDo you remember what time the concert is, and can you tell me?\u201d Therefore, if the friend does not remember, he can"}, {"title": " ", "text": "assign different values to different goals, and that some of our goals might clash, leading to ambivalence; what is important here is that in order for a possible state to be one of our goals, we must at least have some prima facie intention to realize it.

Although options do have some prima facie evaluative load, it is not the case that an agent intends to realize every possibility that he or she sees. When my goal is losing weight, I might come up with different options for realizing that goal. I might start exercising daily, I might go on a diet, I might apply for cosmetic surgery.

The second difference is that options are by definition representations of actions, whereas goals are not.

So, what follows is my initial attempt at doing so. It is not a full or complete account, of course, but it is hopefully enough to begin the discussion. By contrast, much against someone who is able and willing to take up arms against you; otherwise, you are not fighting, but rather are annoying, aggravating, beating, killing, slaughtering, annihilating, destroying, or exterminating. 9 To fight is to contend with another, to struggle against them for supremacy. If there is no contention or struggle, it is difficult to say either that a fight is occurring or has occurred. This is why it is possible for someone to refuse to fight: famously, pacifists and nonviolence advocates refuse to physically fight for their causes. So, when the police attacked U.S. Representative John Lewis at Selma in 1965, it was a physical beating that took place, not a physical fight. 10 You simply cannot fight with someone who will not fight you. Added to that, you cannot fight with someone who cannot fight you; this is why it is impossible to (physically) fight a quadriplegic, for instance.

The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and authentication. Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, authentication, and authorization. Identification Identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement \"Hello, my name is John Doe\" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true.

From the above transcript, it looks as if I might possibly have been referring to one towel in particular (perhaps with the aid of a gesture) and saying of it, as we say, that it did not have a purpose. The pronoun, in other words, might be thought to be referential, if all we had to go on was the above transcript. But this is not what I was doing. I did not have the intention to refer to a particular towel. No gestures accompanied my utterance. And, in terms of intonation, the pronoun was downstressed and did not have the contrastive stress that would be necessary in such circumstances to use the pronoun referentially.

In a nutshell, because some actions may be seen as unacceptably paternalistic in virtue of the fact that they neglect what matters to someone, we should accept a No-Rejection requirement on well-being, which precisely says that what matters to someone is good for this person. Before going further, let me be clear about the status of the two last constraints that I have put forward. My point is not to argue directly that we must accept a certain theory of well-being because some forms of paternalism are wrong. My point is merely to argue that a subjectivist theory of well-being should allow for the rejection of certain actions as wrong and paternalistic because they do not take into account what matters to people. In other words, all things being equal, we should discard subjectivist theories of well-being that would be rejected by anti-paternalists on the grounds that these theories do not tie tightly enough what is good for someone to what matters to him or her. And I argue that the two constraints considered above should be accepted precisely as expressing this theoretical orientation.

External power When power is regarded as a force located outside a dialogical process oriented toward reaching understanding, it is an external condition of the dialogue. Therefore, it is called external power. It is what Carspecken (1999) refers to as coercive power or coercion in communicative action. External power should be neutralized or the dialogue will be distorted. Suppose, for instance, someone asks me to read a paper she has worked on. After a couple of weeks when we met, the person inquires excitingly, \"What did you think about my paper?\" Seeing me remain silent, the person adds, \"It was the third revision I made. Hopefully, it would be accepted this time.\" Showing impatience, I comment, \"I thought it was only the first draft.\" Considering my status as a university professor, the person begins to doubt her own ability and concurs, \"I guess I'd better redo it.\" In this case, my status had an impact on the dialogue.

The ionosphere consists of \u201cions,\u201d a shell of electrons and electrically charged atoms and molecules. Because ions are created through sunlight interacting with the atoms and molecules in the very thin upper atmosphere, the density (thickness and consistency) of the ionosphere varies from day to night. The ionosphere bends radio signals, similar to the way water will bend light signals. That is why you can hear AM radio broadcasts from far away at night. Also, ham radio operators rely on the ionosphere to bounce their signals from their station to the far reaches of the globe. Since GNSS is a radio signal, its measurements are slightly impacted by ionosphere changes, resulting in small increases in position error. For all except very precise GNSS users, these changes are negligible. Note that a total eclipse of the sun is similar to our day-night cycle, only very much faster. So, while the ionosphere will be more dynamic during an eclipse, it will not cause a loss of the GNSS signal. In summary, while any effects from the eclipse are of scientific interest, GNSS service should not be adversely affected by the Aug. 21 Solar Eclipse.

Indeed, in order to have a good communication it is expected that the BER is at least 5 10 bit s The modelling of the ionosphere is performed using first-order approximations taken from [29]. The ionosphere is the upper part of the atmosphere where charged particles are mixed with neutral particles. The charged particles are created by photoionisation caused by incoming UV and X-radiation from the Sun: gas molecules are heated, and electrons are liberated then. The rate of this ionisation depends on the density of gas molecules and the intensity of the radiation. In the neutral atmosphere charged particles are practically absent, since the created charged particles are recombined rapidly due to the high density of particles. In the ionosphere, however, only the charged particles can influence the propagation of radio waves. Mainly, the free electrons affect the propagation since the free ions are much heavier than the electrons. The interaction of the ionosphere with the navigation signal can be decomposed into four sources of delay called first-order, second-order, third-order delay, and geometrical signal bending denoted respectively as (1) i , (2) i , (3) i and \u03ba [29].

Such irregularities cause diffraction effects, mainly due to the random fluctuations of the refractive index of the ionosphere, on the satellites signals passing through them and consequent perturbations may cause GNSS navigation errors and outages, abruptly corrupting its performance.

The first is simply due to the high-energy radiation from the flare. X-rays bombard Earth, knocking electrons off atoms in the ionosphere. This creates an abnormally high density of free electrons in the lower ionosphere and is referred to as a Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance. High frequency (HF) radio waves are absorbed by this increased density, which blocks their \u201cskipping\u201d property and results in a complete blackout of HF communications for minutes to hours. They can also cause waves of noise to roll through the Shortwave (SW) communications bands as well. Solar storms can also impact radio communications due to the plasma that\u2019s blasted out into interplanetary space. Solar particles, most importantly protons, are accelerated to a significant fraction of light speed and reach Earth within less than an hour. Most are deflected by Earth\u2019s protective magnetic field, but some enter the atmosphere at the poles and collide with and ionize air particles. As with the X-rays, this increases the density of the ionosphere at low heights, causing absorption of HF radio communications. These \u201cPolar Cap Absorption\u201d events can last for days and are particularly disruptive to airline communications needed when they commonly fly near the poles to reduce travel times.

Protons with energies higher than \u223c1 MeV have the ability to cause typical semiconductor (Si, GaAs, etc.) devices to malfunction through the effects of total ionizing dose (TID) such as errors caused by Single Event Upsets (SEUs) (Dodd & Massengill, 2003) which cause the excitation of electrons triggering false signals.

Such defects can seriously hamper device function or even cause failure. Underestimation of such risks can degrade the performance of systems aboard spacecrafts and cause important loss of mission lifetime. Such considerations become even more important for manned missions, especially outside the protective shielding of Earth's magnetic field especially with regard to manned missions to the Moon or Mars (Cucinotta et al., 2010).

Most disruptive are coronal mass ejections. A CME is an erupting bubble of tens of millions of tons of gas blown away from the Sun into space. When this bubble reaches Earth a few days after leaving the Sun, it heats the ionosphere, which expands and reaches farther into space. As a consequence, friction between the atmosphere and spacecraft increases, dragging satellites to lower altitudes. At the time of a particularly strong flare and CME in March 1989, the system responsible for tracking some 19,000 objects orbiting Earth temporarily lost track of 11,000 of them because their orbits were changed by the expansion of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. During solar maximum, a number of satellites are brought to such a low altitude that they are destroyed by friction with the atmosphere. Both the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station (Figure 15.24) require reboosts to higher altitude so that they can remain in orbit.

A related subject, space weather, deals with dynamic processes in the solar-terrestrial system that can give rise to effects on spacecraft, but that can also affect the atmosphere, ionosphere and geomagnetic field, giving rise to several other kinds of effects on human technologies. Effects on spacecraft can arise from radiation, space debris and meteoroid impact, upper atmospheric drag and spacecraft electrostatic charging. Radiation in space usually comes from three main sources: The Van Allen radiation belts Solar proton events and solar energetic particles; and Galactic cosmic rays. For long-duration missions, the high doses of radiation can damage electronic components and solar cells. A major concern is also radiation-induced \"single-event effects\" such as single event upset. Crewed missions usually avoid the radiation belts and the International Space Station is at an altitude well below the most severe regions of the radiation belts. During solar energetic events (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) particles can be accelerated to very high energies and can reach the Earth in times as short as 30 minutes (but usually take some hours). These particles are mainly protons and heavier ions that can cause radiation damage, disruption to logic circuits, and even hazards to astronauts.

Briefly, when an object is in orbit it's not flying like an airplane; it's only being controlled by gravity. In general if you put something in orbit it'll stay there forever, falling due to gravity around the planet. However, in low Earth orbit, up to a few hundred kilometers above the surface, there is a little bit of air. It's not much, because the atmosphere thins with height, but even at 400 km or so there's some. Every time an orbiting spacecraft hits an air molecule, that collision robs the craft of a little bit of energy. Over time that lowers the orbit of the spacecraft. Usually, spacecraft can be reboosted to a higher orbit; the International Space Station (ISS) has done this many times. During servicing missions, the Shuttle was used to boost the Hubble Space Telescope higher in orbit as well. Left unchecked, though, this lowering orbital height is a vicious circle.

Is there a similar problem when it is going the other way, at take off? It is going through the same amount of air and acceleration looks quite similar to deceleration, only the other way around.\" The only answer that I could think of is that a good part of the acceleration might take place at higher altitudes where there is less air, and braking is done only by using the atmosphere. Going up, it is the rocket engine which provides acceleration and energy.

Any re-entry prediction is *always* associated with a window of uncertainty given the unknowns described above. Many media outlets will give the re-entry time and even locations as absolute values, but the truth is that when re-entry is still several days away, the error bar on any prediction can be 24 hours in either direction or more.

Generally, electric propulsion is used for two purposes in Earth-orbiting spacecraft: for correcting the orbit (station-keeping) and for raising the orbit from an intermediate to the target one (in relatively recent all-electric GEO sats) Station-keeping requires relatively short burns (sub-hour to several hours) in all directions. When raising the orbit, the spacecraft usually keeps itself in fixed position relative to the Sun to maximize the solar panel output. The propulsion unit keeps working at all times, both in prograde and retrograde, because efficient Hall thrusters are tricky to work with in impulse mode, and are heavily optimized for continuous operation. So in most cases, xenon is ejected in arbitrary directions, retrograde being only one of them.

Once the spacecraft has been carefully navigated to fall through the re-entry corridor, the thermodynamics comes into play. The air, as we know, is composed of mainly two diatomic molecules: oxygen and nitrogen. Ordinarily, when air pressure is low, they remain in this diatomic state. However, under special circumstances like atmospheric re-entry, they behave differently. During re-entry, as the spacecraft falls under gravity and enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the increasing density of the atmosphere combined with the tremendous speed of the spacecraft (of the order of 7-8,000 metres per second) causes a shock wave leading to an enormous rise in the pressure in front of it.

If the attitude control mechanism (magnetic torques) fails somewhere during the coming days and the drag reducing attitude is lost as a result, GOCE will come down much earlier than the current forecast suggests. That is one reason to be very cautious with GOCE re-entry predictions, certainly at this point in time. It is currently impossible to say if, and if so when, such a loss of attitude will happen.

This results in an ionisation blackout, with the ionised air blocking radio communication with the ground during re-entry. Although not a direct hazard, it can cause complications in the event of a safety issue arising during re-entry which could endanger the spacecraft. Finally, in order to land, the descent rate must be slowed dramatically. In the Apollo missions and with non-reusable space probes, parachutes are used to slow the descent to make a gentle landing. The space shuttle uses wings to generate lift, enabling it to glide to a gentle landing. Remember- To re-enter, you need strong heat shielding and an approach with a specific angle of descent.

They break free for practical purposes where the mesosphere and thermosphere merge at an altitude that averages about 60 miles (95 kilometers). Frictional heat consumes space vehicles of all kinds when they reenter Earth's atmosphere at high velocities unless a shield protects exteriors and insulation keeps crews (if any) and other contents acceptably cool. Apollo command modules returning from the Moon, for example, had to offset 5,000 \u00b0F (1,900 \u00b0C), four times that of blast furnaces. Friction nevertheless exerts some positive effects. Aerodynamic drag at the interface where atmosphere and space imperceptibly merge can act as a brake or alter orbit configurations without burning fuel, provided computers calculate reentry angles correctly. Spacecraft skip or bounce back erratically when trajectories are too shallow and incineration results when they are too steep, but reentry windows as a rule open wider for powered vehicles than for those that glide. #### **GRAVITY** Propulsion systems must be powerful enough to boost military spacecraft into orbit, despite atmospheric drag and gravity (g), which keeps objects on Earth without an anchor and pulls unsupported bodies from atmosphere or space toward the surface.

Let's pretend for a moment that the atmosphere had sea-level density, pressure, and temperature all the way up to, say 500km high, and then would abruptly end in a complete vaccum. In such a situation you could have a glider orbiting at 501km high which could do a very graceful, low temperature reentry by simply slowing down the angular velocity and then using aerodynamic lift at, say, a 1:30 gliding ratio to drastically reduce the rate in which potential energy gets released. Or even have a completely vertical entry using a simple parachute.. With our real atmosphere though it seems that all reentries are at very steep angles and at very high radial velocities. Why? Is this a direct consequence of the low density at high altitudes, which necessitates a far higher velocity to reach the same lift/drag, and that high velocity contributes to increasing the temperature far more than the low density contributes to decreasing the temperature? A: by simply slowing down the angular velocity As simple as this sounds, it is a huge problem in practice. The orbital speed is roughly 17,000 mph. To reduce this to subsonic speed all the while maintaining altitude would require a rather large reentry \"stage\" similar in capability, I would imagine, to the third stage of the Saturn V.

Near the end of the first orbit the automatic control system wasn't functioning properly. I went to manual control and continued in that mode during the second and third orbits, and during re-entry. To \"go manual\" so abruptly was not the way the flight was planned. Another problem involved a signal sent to the ground via telemetry indicating the heat shield was loose. To make sure it was secured in place during re-entry I kept the retrorocket pack in place to steady the shield. I thought the retropack would burn off during re-entry, but at that point there would be sufficient aerodynamic force on the shield to keep it in place. And that's the way it worked.

The Apollo heat shield was the beginning of a long race for a safer, cheaper, and more convenient thermal protection system.

Once the spacecraft has been carefully navigated to fall through the re-entry corridor, the thermodynamics comes into play. The air, as we know, is composed of mainly two diatomic molecules: oxygen and nitrogen. Ordinarily, when air pressure is low, they remain in this diatomic state. However, under special circumstances like atmospheric re-entry, they behave differently. During re-entry, as the spacecraft falls under gravity and enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the increasing density of the atmosphere combined with the tremendous speed of the spacecraft (of the order of 7-8,000 metres per second) causes a shock wave leading to an enormous rise in the pressure in front of it. At approximately 70 to 80 km above Earth, this pressure becomes so large that it causes the diatomic oxygen and (after some time) nitrogen to split causing further reactions. These reactions are extremely exothermic \u2013 meaning they release a lot of heat. This heat is so significant that we need special arrangements to protect what\u2019s inside the spacecraft.

The D'Alembert's inertial forces created in the vehicle's structure during such changes of trajectory would kill the crew and destroy the antigravitational vehicle. One of the most serious problems resulting from the repulsion of the antigravitational spacecraft from every other object would be the impossibility of reaching the surface of heavier planets after leaving from lighter heavenly bodies. For example, having started from Earth the spacecraft would not be able to reach Jupiter or Saturn, whereas after starting from the Moon it would not be able to reach Earth. The reason for this is that the velocity gained by the vehicle during its interaction with the field of a lighter planet would not be sufficient to break through the sphere of the stronger repulsion from a heavier planet. Therefore it is possible that such a spacecraft once launched would never achieve its destination, and would also be unable to return.

When the first stage of Falcon 9 is jettisoned, the rocket is travelling at ten times the speed of sound, 90km above the surface.

But unlike the REBR, which simply downloads data via satellite link for later analysis, the R-DBAS is intended as a direct communication tool with the end user. As a spacecraft carrying R-DBAS hits the atmosphere, it relays a message with the coordinates of the falling debris area to anyone with a receiver and a display, such as a laptop or iPad , warning them of the hazard.

Such an effect depends on atmospheric variations of density and winds that are difficult to model. When the skipping ends and atmospheric reentry starts, the trajectory and the overall location of surviving fragments can be precisely predicted but the time to impact the ground or to reach airspace is at that point very short.

Radio signals can and do collide with other objects in space, and definitely do disperse between the spacecraft and the Earth, but they will reach the Earth for two reasons. The first; even though our solar system has a lot of stuff in it, the vast majority of it is still empty space. The second is that all spacecraft are equipped with finely tuned and precisely calibrated antennas, which allow them to aim their signal directly at the earth, rather than beaming its signal in every direction. Beaming signal in every direction would require a lot of power to produce, so it\u2019s much more efficient to use a smaller amount of power to limit the signal to only direction you care about, i.e., in the direction of Earth. Now, if you\u2019re a spacecraft orbiting another planet, you can easily imagine that the planet will occasionally get in the way of you beaming information back to the Earth. Radio signals do not go through planets, and nor do they go on curved paths. So the spacecraft, in these times, must be capable of running itself for a while, before it comes back around from the far side of the planet (from an Earthly perspective). During these times the spacecraft are always in a communications blackout, and totally unable to communicate with us on Earth.

DiamondDiamond Another contributing factor is that the LEO satellite, at altitudes of 1-6 Mm, is getting pounded by the inner Van Allen belt. RogerRoger GEO satellites tend to be large satellites, because they have to be larger to support their missions. When you have to make them larger, then they are built with additional redundancy. In addition, GEO satellites do not have as many eclipses, they have them at most once a day for 90 minutes during eclipse season. For LEO satellites, their death tends to be due to poor batteries. The batteries are very stressed due to the constant use that they require. GEO satellites tend to end their lives when the fuel runs out. Fuel requirements are usually easier than batteries. LEO satellites tend to require a constellation to work effective. The redundancy in many ways is that there are usually other satellites in orbit that can \"pick up the slack\" if one of them fails. GEO satellites tend to require being in a specific location, and cannot support that kind of redundancy. Bottom line is, LEO satellites are built smaller, cheaper, and with lower lifetimes, and have more battery stress than GEO satellites. $\\begingroup$ I think you are quite right about the greater stress"}, {"title": " ", "text": "primary use being for station-keeping once delivered to GEO and they have not spent a long time in transit.

One of the outstanding questions about Mars is how it came to lose most of its atmosphere. One possibility is that the solar wind, the stream of charged particles flowing out from the Sun, has gradually stripped the atmosphere away through interactions with the ionosphere. The radio science experiment will measure density profiles in the ionosphere, which will help determine whether, how and when this happened. The speed of a spacecraft relative to the ground station can be measured with an accuracy of \"less than one tenth the speed of a snail at full pace,\" according to P\u00e4tzold.

Because of the unique operation environment of the SPP mission, many factors must be understood in order to maintain adequate communications with the spacecraft. First, the highly elliptical solar orbits across the inner solar system cause frequent solar conjunctions, sometimes with extended periods. And secondly, the spacecraft's TPS obstructs the view of the antenna and causes extra outage of communication times. The X-band is baselined for spacecraft tracking for navigation and works for both uplink and downlink modes. The Ka-band is mainly for science data downlink and works only for the downlink mode. Besides the communication outage due to the solar conjunctions attributed to the viewing geometry of Sun, Earth, and the spacecraft, the TPS of the spacecraft sometimes causes additional outage.

Radio signals can and do collide with other objects in space, and definitely do disperse between the spacecraft and the Earth, but they will reach the Earth for two reasons. The first; even though our solar system has a lot of stuff in it, the vast majority of it is still empty space. The second is that all spacecraft are equipped with finely tuned and precisely calibrated antennas, which allow them to aim their signal directly at the earth, rather than beaming its signal in every direction. Beaming signal in every direction would require a lot of power to produce, so it\u2019s much more efficient to use a smaller amount of power to limit the signal to only direction you care about, i.e., in the direction of Earth. Now, if you\u2019re a spacecraft orbiting another planet, you can easily imagine that the planet will occasionally get in the way of you beaming information back to the Earth. Radio signals do not go through planets, and nor do they go on curved paths. So the spacecraft, in these times, must be capable of running itself for a while, before it comes back around from the far side of the planet (from an Earthly perspective).

Because they serve as high-power telecommunications relays, Maxar\u2019s satellites must dissipate the many kilowatts of waste heat generated by their microwave power amplifiers.

This potentially causes schedule delays, cost overruns, and adds risk to the mission success. This paper will discuss how a single interface, representing the payload at the launch site in all phases of development, will mitigate risk, and minimize or even alleviate potential problems later on.

This plays a crucial role in knowing its position and orbit at a particular instant of time. All these happen at 'S-band' frequencies in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Additionally, as it orbits the Moon, the spacecraft sends valuable imagery and other scientific information to earth through X-band (at a higher frequency compared to S-band), which also lies in the microwave region. But, such information is transmitted through radio at a very low power of a few Watts. Thus, radio signals carrying that precious information become extremely feeble by the time they travel 400,000 km from the moon and reach the earth. The ground segment of Chandrayaan-1 performs the crucial task of receiving the radio signals sent by the spacecraft. It also transmits the radio commands to be sent to the spacecraft during different phases of its mission. Besides, it processes and safe keeps the scientific information sent by the spacecraft.

Under this program, Canada built and NASA launched Alouette 2 in 1965, ISIS 1 in 1969 and ISIS 2 in 1971. All were successful and advanced scientific knowledge about the ionosphere and its impact on radio communications. The Alouette and ISIS satellites are remembered for being scientific in nature. Yet they were aimed at understanding problems affecting communications in Canada and should be seen as an applied science or even as a communications program that was a natural predecessor to Canada\u2019s communications satellites.

Such a dense atmosphere tends to absorb rather than reflect radio waves, especially at lower frequencies. Table 1 - Relative conductivity of various types of terrain. But in the sparse regions of the ionosphere where there are relatively few gas molecules, the ions reattach themselves at fairly slow rates. In the upper regions of the ionosphere, called the F2 layer, recombination is so slow as to be relatively unimportant. The important thing about these ions is that they make the atmosphere electrically conductive. Thus the electromagnetic energy of a radio wave is partially transformed into kinetic energy represented by the motions of the ions. If these ions do not recombine, this energy is converted back to electromagnetic energy and the radio wave continues to be propagated. If, on the other hand, the ions recombine, absorption of the radio wave occurs and the wave is sharply attenuated. Now, one of the most important factors about this ionization is the fact that the greater the degree of ionization, the higher the frequency that will be refracted and returned to the surface of the earth. For any one frequency, there is a degree of ionization that is required to refract the wave sufficiently to return it to earth depending upon the angle of radiation.

The ionosphere exists because of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. It breaks apart the atmospheric molecules that remain at these altitudes, knocking off electrons, leaving a sea of ions and charged electrons. This region of charged particles exists alongside the very thin upper atmosphere.

This is because at altitudes of higher density, there are more ions and subsequently more possibility for collisions, which are the cause of deionization. In the E and F layers, the density is low enough such that these collisions do not happen as often as in the D layer, meaning that these two layers remain ionized long after radiation has stopped being applied. In fact, they remain ionized throughout the entire night, whereas the D layer loses its ionization during the night. This property of the ionosphere is what allows for radio communication via sky waves. At the ion density of the E and F layers during both day and night, LF and VLF radio waves reflect off of the ions, propagating back down to the surface of the earth. However, the properties of the D layer provide some difficulties. During the day, the ion density is too high for some LF, and especially VLF, radio waves to pass through to then be reflected off of the E or F layers. Instead, the waves are absorbed by the ions.

This means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed, leading to the interference phenomena we have mentioned. For these interference patterns to occur though, there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave. Otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard. The received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day. This suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets. Appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record. This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the sun\u2019s influence. At sunset, the intensity of the sun\u2019s radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than it is high up in the atmosphere. This means ionic recombination will progress slowly from lower altitudes to higher ones and therefore the height at which waves are reflected slowly increases as the sun sets. 2019 The basic idea behind Appleton\u2019s work is so simple that it is"}, {"title": " ", "text": "ion density that was standard for that time of day). However, the research done was inconclusive, and so other experiments, including EclipseMob, have since aimed at providing greater understanding of how the solar eclipse affects the ionosphere. Radio Communication and the Ionosphere: Radio communication utilizes two different forms of transmission based upon the distance that the wave must travel. For short distance communication, ground waves are sufficient. Ground waves are as they sound: a radio wave propagated at a near-ground level. This form of communication is highly effective as it encounters less interference than the alternative sky waves. Since ground waves cannot bend in accordance with the surface of the earth, ground wave communication is limited to certain distances. When longer distance communication is necessary, radio waves are instead propagated at a calculated angle towards the sky. These waves generally reflect off of the ionosphere to be received in another location. This method allows radio waves to travel a much farther distance, but there is a disadvantage. The ionosphere is split into D, E, F\u00b9, and F\u00b2 layers, where the D layer has the lowest altitude and therefore highest gas density, and the F\u00b2 layer has the highest altitude and therefore lowest gas density. The ionosphere, as its name suggests, is the layer of the atmosphere in which gas ionizes through ultraviolet radiation from the sun. As such, ion density is highest during the day and lowest during the night.

Since the atmosphere is bombarded by ultraviolet light waves of different frequencies, several ionized layers are formed at different altitudes. Lower frequency ultraviolet waves penetrate the atmosphere the least; therefore, they produce ionized layers at the higher altitudes. Conversely, ultraviolet waves of higher frequencies penetrate deeper and produce layers at the lower altitudes. An important factor in determining the density of ionized layers is the elevation angle of the sun, which changes frequently. For this reason, the height and thickness of the ionized layers vary, depending on the time of day and even the season of the year. Recombination Recall that the process of ionization involves ultraviolet light waves knocking electrons free from their atoms. A reverse process called RECOMBINATION occurs when the free electrons and positive ions collide with each other. Since these collisions are inevitable, the positive ions return to their original neutral atom state. The recombination process also depends on the time of day. Between the hours of early morning and late afternoon, the rate of ionization exceeds the rate of recombination. During this period, the ionized layers reach their greatest density and exert maximum influence on radio waves. During the late afternoon and early evening hours, however, the rate of recombination exceeds the rate of ionization, and the density of the ionized layers begins to decrease. Throughout the night, density continues to decrease, reaching a low point just before sunrise.

That is why they would NOT use planes, they can\u2019t fly high enough. Yes it does. It\u2019s a research facility, and not an operational facility. It has no real ability to DO anything other than excite the ionosphere in a spot for a few minutes. The military\u2019s interest is partly explained in the FAQ: Because the DoD operates numerous communication and navigation systems whose signals either depend on reflection from the ionosphere or must pass through the ionosphere to satellites, there is obvious DoD interest in understanding the ionosphere\u2019s effect on these systems to improve their reliability and performance.

Yes experiments have been done to to increase ion concentrations in the atmosphere in order to extend the range of radio communications or radar signals in an emergency.

Firstly, such experiments are conducted in the ionosphere, which is an extremely high altitude region of the atmosphere, a near vacuum \u201con the edge of space\u201d, because at higher atmospheric pressures the ions would recombine too quickly. The air is so thin at these extreme altitudes that aircraft cannot fly there; experiments are conducted by sounding rockets, not by airplanes.

Does the ionosphere affect radio? The ionosphere is a particularly important region with regards to radio signal propagation and radio communications in general. While the ions give the ionosphere its name, but it is the free electrons that affect the radio waves and radio communications. Why do planes fly at 38000 feet? Due to lower resistance at higher altitudes, commercial airplanes can keep moving forward with minimal fuel expenditure. Commercial airplanes typically fly between 32,000 feet and 38,000 feet, with the sweet spot being approximately 35,000 feet, which is popularly referred to as cruising altitude. Can you breathe in the stratosphere? The stratosphere is not a good place to be. First, the ozone in the stratosphere, which protects us from biologically destructive solar ultraviolet light, exists at such high levels that the air itself is toxic. Second, even this toxic air is much too thin for normal breathing. What happens if a window breaks on an airplane? Basically, the air pressure inside the cabin is higher than it is outside of the plane to enable the people onboard to breathe normally. That's why, if a window happens to break, the air inside would escape at high speeds, taking small objects like phones or magazines (or sometimes larger things, like people) with it.

As spacecraft, like the Apollo Command Module depicted in this artist's concept, enter the atmosphere, a plasma sheath engulfs them that can cut off communication signals with the ground. CREDIT: NASA Gao and his colleague Binhao Jiang have proposed a new way to maintain communication with spacecraft as they re-enter the atmosphere. The approach might also be applied to other hypersonic vehicles such as futuristic military planes and ballistic missiles. They discuss their approach in this week\u2019s Journal of Applied Physics, from AIP Publishing. Communication blackouts with hypersonic vehicles occur because as the craft zips along at five or more times the speed of sound, an envelope of hot ionized air, called a plasma sheath, surrounds it. This plasma sheath will reflect electromagnetic signals under most conditions, cutting off connection with anything outside of the vehicle. However, under certain special conditions, a plasma sheath can actually enhance the radiation from a communication antenna. Gao and his colleagues reasoned that it would be possible to replicate these special conditions in ordinary hypersonic flight by redesigning the antenna. The researchers first analyzed earlier experiments and found that the special signal enhancement could be explained by a resonance, or"}, {"title": " ", "text": "An artist's illustration of the superhot plasma around a spacecraft like NASA's Apollo command module that can block communications and cause a radio blackout during the critical re-entry of a spacecraft. When future spacecraft re-enter the atmosphere, a new kind of antenna might help them keep in contact with ground control, despite the fiery sheaths of superhot plasma around them, researchers say. The technology might also help keep communication lines open to other hypersonic vehicles, such as military planes and ballistic missiles. As NASA's Apollo 13 crisis revealed in 1970, this radio silence can be fraught with extraordinary tension. As the crippled spacecraft plummeted back toward Earth, the communications blackout lasted more than a minute longer than expected, leaving ground control in tortured suspense over whether the three astronauts aboard had survived. \"When a re-entry vehicle is unable to be connected, the only thing you can do is pray for it,\" study lead author Xiaotian Gao, a physicist at the Harbin Institute of Technology in China, said in a statement. Prior studies have tried to solve this communication blackout problem, but they all had their shortcomings. For instance, scientists have suggested changing the shape of hypersonic vehicles, because sharp-nosed vehicles have thinner plasma sheaths than blunt-nosed ones. But sometimes, blunt-nosed bodies are preferable because they can withstand heat better and slow down more quickly. Other approaches involve using magnetic fields to control the plasma sheath, or injecting water or other liquids into the plasma sheath to make it more permeable to radio signals, but these methods"}, {"title": " ", "text": "13 crew, the real drama is just as palpable \u2013 if not more \u2014 than in the movie.

The wind is also insufficient to knock over the MAV, which, being critical hardware, would be designed with this in mind if it were true! But those of us who have worked real flights know that despite all our contingency plans, training, and malfunction procedures, things fail, explode, melt, freeze, or just plain refuse to function. And communications systems are notorious for finding creative new ways to not work. Shoot, even if the communications systems work, computers (also notoriously creative in failure modes) can keep them from delivering any meaningful data. Certainly no one anticipated the fire that took out the Mission Operations Computer during STS-5, severing all communications with the orbiter (at a time when the backup MOC was also down).

The reason the music can be heard clearly is that astronaut Al Worden played it into his microphone specifically so that it would be heard in mission control. He said \"I thought I was playing it only for Houston.\" Source (Entry at 171:37:25). The reason the engine was not also heard is that, as mentioned in the answer to question 11, it did not make a loud noise in the cabin. 13. The lift-off from the moon is possibly the most delicate moment of the entire mission. The astronauts must keep their total concentration, and they must be able to communicate with one another instantly, in case something were to go wrong. Why then put their safety at risk by playing loud music inside the cabin, which could have distracted them from the operations and could have kept them from communicating clearly in a moment of distress?

Flight test objectives were to measure thrust and to examine electromagnetic compatibility with other spacecraft subsystems. The 5-cm-diameter thrusters were designed to operate at 0.02 kW and provide about 89 mN thrust at about 6700 s specific impulse. Thrusters had the capability to operate at 5 setpoints from 18 mN to 89 mN. Thrusters were configured so they could be used for East-West stationkeeping. Prior to launch, a 5-cm cesium thruster was life tested for 2245 hours at the 67 mN thrust level. During the launch process the Centaur stage did not achieve a second burn, and the spacecraft remained attached to the Centaur in a 218 km by 760 km orbit.

At altitudes below 200-250 km and for beam energies around 1 keV, it is shown that secondary electrons supply a significant contribution to the return current to the spacecraft and thereby reduce the spacecraft potential.

INTRODUCTION Ionospheric sounding has been a standard tool for probing the ionosphere for many years. Principles of the sounding are based on the reflection of the radio waves from the ionized component of Earth's upper atmosphere (Appleton, 1927). Ionospheric sounders operate by transmitting a short pulse at a fixed frequency, and then detecting any echoes that are reflected. These echoes relate to the altitude where the plasma frequency is equal to the wave frequency. By measuring the time delay between the transmission of the pulse and the time that the echo is received, the range to the reflection point can be computed. By sequentially stepping the transmitter frequency after each transmit-receive cycle, the time delay, and hence the range to the reflection point, can be determined as a function of frequency. However, since radio waves return to the groundbased radar from only the portion of the ionosphere below the level of maximum electron density, no information about the ionosphere above this level can be retrieved. To perform topside sounding, ionosondes were fist mounted on rockets (Knecht et al., 1961) and later on satellites [Alouette (Lockwood, 1963), ISIS 1, 2 (McAfee, 1969)].

Two phenomena in the ionosphere \u2014 equatorial plasma bubbles and scintillation \u2014 have impacted radio communication systems, satellite technologies and global positioning system (GPS) signals for decades, said Jim Spann, chief scientist for the Science and Technology Directorate at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Equatorial plasma bubbles are regions of comparatively low density which may elongate into towering plumes during high-intensity periods. Scintillation is a unique type of atmospheric fluctuation that can interrupt radio frequencies, much like the \u201ctwinkling\u201d effect seen in starlight when optical frequencies are disrupted.

These have come from Chinese rockets, North Korean missile launches, and some of SpaceX\u2018s other, more conventional Falcon 9 launches. In the case of Formosat-5 mission, the rocket reached an altitude of 300km after about 5 minutes, and because of its vertical motion, it created not a V-shaped wave but rather giant, circular shock waves, according to a new paper in Space Weather. These circular waves extended over 1.8 million square km, or about four times the area of California, over the western United States and Pacific Ocean region.

During the ARD mission, which involves a 70% scaled-down configuration capsule of the Apollo command module, radio frequency blackout and strong plasma attenuation of radio waves in communications with data relay satellites and air planes were observed. The electromagnetic interference was caused by highly dense plasma derived from a strong shock wave generated in front of the capsule because of orbital speed during reentry. In this study, the physical properties of the plasma flow in the shock layer and wake region of the ESA ARD were obtained using a computational fluid dynamics technique. Then, electromagnetic waves were expressed using a frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain method using the plasma properties. The analysis model was validated based on experimental flight data. A comparison of the measured and predicted results showed good agreement. The distribution of charged particles around the ESA ARD and the complicated behavior of electromagnetic waves, with attenuation and reflection, are clarified in detail. It is suggested that the analysis model could be an effective tool for investigating radio frequency blackout and plasma attenuation in radio wave communication.

Some of the ambient plasma penetrates all the way down to Earth's atmosphere, where it excites molecules in the atmosphere, and they give off light as they de-excite. This is the origin of the auroral lights seen near Earth's poles. Consequently, researching magnetic reconnection is a major aspect of understanding the Sun and the Sun's impact on Earth's space environment; that field of study is called \u201cheliophysics\u201d or \u201cgeospace sciences.\u201d There are numerous practical reasons we care about magnetic reconnection. When a flare occurs, it emits energetic radiation that travels through space and gets absorbed in Earth's atmosphere. Some of the neutral material gets ionized, increasing how much plasma is in the ionosphere. This has important consequences. Satellites can go off their desired course since there is more resistance in the ionosphere. Also, satellites send signals through the ionosphere, and the path those signals take changes, just like light bends when going from air to water and vice versa.

Travelling ionospheric disturbance are themselves a category of geomagnetically induced currents. When a solar flare occurs on the Sun a blast of intense ultraviolet (UV) and x-ray (sometimes even gamma ray) radiation hits the dayside of the Earth after a propagation time of about 8 minutes. This high energy radiation is absorbed by atmospheric particles, raising them to excited states and knocking electrons free in the process of photoionization. The low altitude ionospheric layers (D region and E region) immediately increase in density over the entire dayside. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. Scientists on the ground can use this enhancement to detect solar flares; by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate when solar flares have taken place.

The possible damage the plume may cause on the host spacecraft is the main reason why it has been and is still a great concern in using electric propulsion systems to propel a spacecraft rather than using conventional chemical propulsion [6]. One of the major problems with the plasma plume is that the accelerated ions might undergo charge exchange collisions with the slow neutrals, which then produces slow ions that can backscatter and deposit on the thruster body, solar panels, scientific instruments, etc. In the early 1970s a \"Porcupine\" rocket project was launched to investigate the behavior of an artificial ion beam in the Ionosphere. The results showed that the Xenon ion beam induced high-frequency turbulence as far away as 100 m from the thruster [7,8].

This results in density striations in the atmosphere that were never previously observed. Such density variations are necessary data to include when modeling interference with radio waves or excess drag on a travelling spacecraft. Rob Pfaff, project scientist for CINDI at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and principal investigator for another C/NOFS instrument, the Vector Electric Field Investigation, is studying observations that speak to one of the original goals of the C/NOFS program: Why does the low latitude ionosphere at night become so turbulent that it can wreak havoc on communications and navigation radio signals? Developing the capability to predict such space weather disturbances has been a long-standing goal of the Air Force Research Laboratory.

It was proposed that impulses acting on the boundary might lead to a trapping of these waves on the dayside by the ionosphere, resulting in a standing wave or eigenmode of the magnetopause surface. No direct observational evidence of this has been found to date and searches for indirect evidence have proved inconclusive, leading to speculation that this mechanism might not occur. By using fortuitous multipoint spacecraft observations during a rare isolated fast plasma jet impinging on the boundary, here we show that the resulting magnetopause motion and magnetospheric ultra-low frequency waves at well-defined frequencies are in agreement with and can only be explained by the magnetopause surface eigenmode. We therefore show through direct observations that this mechanism, which should impact upon the magnetospheric system globally, does in fact occur. \\section*{Introduction} Planetary magnetic fields act as obstacles to solar/stellar winds with their interaction forming a well-defined region of space known as a magnetosphere. The outer boundary of a magnetosphere, the magnetopause, is arguably the most significant since it controls the flux of mass, energy, and momentum both into and out of the system, with the boundary's motion thus having wide ranging consequences. Magnetopause dynamics, for example, can cause loss of relativistic radiation belt electrons \\cite{li97}; result in field-aligned currents directing energy to the ionosphere \\cite{haerendel13}; and launch numerous modes of magnetospheric ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves \\cite{plaschke16,hwang16} that themselves transfer solar wind energy to radiation belt"}, {"title": " ", "text": "Lunar ionosphere exploration method using auroral kilometric radiation The evidence of a lunar ionosphere provided by radio occultation experiments performed by the Soviet spacecraft Luna 19 and 22 has been controversial for the past three decades because the observed large density is difficult to explain theoretically without magnetic shielding from the solar wind. The KAGUYA mission provided an opportunity to investigate the lunar ionosphere with another method. The natural plasma wave receiver (NPW) and waveform capture (WFC) instruments, which are subsystems of the lunar radar sounder (LRS) on board the lunar orbiter KAGUYA, frequently observe auroral kilometric radiation (AKR) propagating from the Earth. The dynamic spectra of the AKR sometimes exhibit a clear interference pattern that is caused by phase differences between direct waves and waves reflected on a lunar surface or a lunar ionosphere if it exists. It was hypothesized that the electron density profiles above the lunar surface could be evaluated by comparing the observed interference pattern with the theoretical interference patterns constructed from the profiles with ray tracing. This method provides a new approach to examining the lunar ionosphere that does not involve the conventional radio occultation technique."}, {"title": " ", "text": "atmosphere.

The electron mass amplification is utilized and the reaction rates involving electron are modified correspondingly. A weighting factor scheme for trace species is proposed, and its impacts on collision mechanism, the realization of chemical reactions as well as the calculations of macroscopic parameters are considered. The proposed DSMC algorithm is highly efficient in simulating weakly inhomogeneous flows, and its reliability is validated by the comparisons with aerodynamics force test of Shenzhou capsule model in low density wind tunnel, the electron number densities of RAM-C II and Stardust in rarefied transitional flow regimes.

Aurorae are a result of an enormous global electrical circuit that carries current along the lines of magnetic force to the ionosphere. These FACs (Field Aligned Currents), or Birkeland currents, couple stresses in the magnetosphere to the ionosphere and drive polar ionospheric dynamics. Although an understanding of the basic configuration of these currents exists, there is little knowledge so far about their variability. In particular, during geomagnetic storms, aurorae and their current systems can expand toward the equator, as seen by ground observatories; a very limited knowledge of these most interesting and important events is available. From a LEO perspective, the Birkeland current signatures are typically hundreds of nT so they are relatively easy to detect with commercial-grade attitude magnetometers. The average configuration of the Birkeland currents was first determined by magnetic field measurements of the TRIAD (Transit- Improved DISCOS) series spacecraft of the US Navy (launch of TRID-1 on Sept. 2, 1972) using data collected over a period of 16 months.

ICON will investigate the forces at play in the near-space environment. We've known for many years that the Sun has a significant effect on this region of the upper atmosphere. As the Earth rotates, a new portion of its atmosphere is exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation, which heats and partially ionizes the neutral atoms and molecules, creating the ionosphere. At night, when that portion of the atmosphere is not exposed to the Sun, this ionized gas, or \u201cplasma\u201d tends to recombine, dramatically reducing its density as it converts back to an electrically neutral state. In between, near sunset, the low-latitude ionosphere is dominated by a \u201cplasma fountain\u201d, which results in a dramatic upwelling of ionized gas. This results in a sharp increase of the density of ionized gas in narrow bands on either side of the magnetic equator.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the time when a rocket launches, it does not go straight up into outer space. Rather, shortly after launch, most rockets will begin to pitch over into the downrange direction, limiting gravity drag and stress on the vehicle. Often, by 80 or 100km, a rocket is traveling nearly parallel to the Earth\u2019s surface before releasing its payload into orbit. However, in August of last year, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch from California did not make such a pitch over maneuver. Rather, the Formosat-5 mission launched vertically and stayed that way for most of its ascent into space. The rocket could do this because the Taiwanese payload was light for the Falcon 9 rocket, weighing only 475kg and bound for an orbit 720km above the Earth\u2019s surface. As a result of this launch profile, the rocket maintained a nearly vertical trajectory all the way through much of the Earth\u2019s ionosphere, which ranges from about 60km above the planet to 1,000km up. In doing so, the Falcon 9 booster and its second stage created unique, circular shockwaves. The rocket launch also punched a temporary, 900-km-wide hole into the plasma of the ionosphere.

In addition to interfering with communications signals, space weather in the ionosphere can also prematurely decay spacecraft orbits and expose astronauts to radiation-borne health risks. Historically, this critical region of near-Earth space has been difficult to observe. Spacecraft can't travel through the low parts of the ionosphere and balloons can't travel high enough. \"ICON has an important job to do \u2013 to help us understand the dynamic space environment near our home,\" said Nicola Fox, director for heliophysics at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"ICON will be the first mission to simultaneously track what's happening in Earth's upper atmosphere and in space to see how the two interact, causing the kind of changes that can disrupt our communications systems.\" ICON explores the connections between the neutral atmosphere and the electrically charged ionosphere with four instruments.

Space may look empty, but the ionosphere brims with electrically charged gases, solar radiation, and electric and magnetic fields. Turbulence in this sea of charged particles can manifest as disruptions that interfere with orbiting satellites or communication and navigation signals used, for example, to guide airplanes, ships and self-driving cars. Depending on the energy it absorbs from the Sun, the ionosphere grows and shrinks. For that reason, scientists long thought this part of space was only affected by what happens in the space above it.

Fortunately, the whole isn\u2019t permanent, but it will have lingering consequences for Earth, especially as the company continues to launch rockets into space. The hole was torn in the upper most part of the atmosphere, known as the ionosphere, where the sun\u2019s energy in addition to cosmic radiation ionize atoms, meaning they lose electrons, which bounce around unbound, while the atoms themselves have a positive charge. This particular atomic configuration is what helps radio signals bounce from one side of the planet to the other. The Falcon 9 disrupted this configuration because of the way it was launched. Whereas most rockets travel nearly parallel to the Earth for nearly 100 km of their journey, the Falcon 9 was launched vertically, given that its weight load was smaller than what most rockets carry into space. Given its vertical path, the Falcon 9 created intense shockwaves that cut open the ionosphere. The opening lasted for a full three hours.

This allows the space crafts to carry larger and heavier objects into orbit than would be physically possible with a vertical flight path.

GREENBELT, Md. (NASA PR) \u2014 On Oct.10, 2019, NASA launches the Ionospheric Connection Explorer, or ICON, a spacecraft that will explore the dynamic region where Earth meets space: the ionosphere. Overlapping the farthest reaches of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the very beginning of space, the ionosphere stretches roughly 50 to 400 miles above the surface. Solar radiation cooks tenuous gases there until they lose an electron (or two or three), creating a sea of electrically charged ions and electrons. Neither fully Earth nor space, the ionosphere reacts both to winds and weather from the lower atmosphere below and solar energy streaming in from above, changing constantly to form conditions we call space weather. \u201cAfter years of work, I\u2019m excited to get into orbit and turn on the spacecraft, open the doors on all our instruments,\u201d said Thomas Immel, ICON principal investigator at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cICON carries incredible capacity for science.

Half of the descent module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry; this half faces forward during reentry. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the descent module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere \u2013 as the pioneering Vostok spacecraft's descent module used \u2013 but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely ballistic reentry. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn.

Gagarin telegraphed \"Everything is OK\" despite continuing gyrations; he later reported that he did not want to \"make noise\" as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module).

Re-entry and aftermath The mission was considered a great success, both technically and as a public-relations exercise for both nations. The only serious problem was during reentry and splashdown of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic nitrogen tetroxide fumes, caused by the reaction control system (RCS) oxidizer venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and nitrogen tetroxide was sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in Honolulu.[17] Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believes he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and initiated drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.[18] The ASTP was the final flight of an Apollo spacecraft.

These were mounted in the retrograde section of the adapter module, located just behind the capsule's heat shield.[3][4] Apollo program[edit] For lunar flights, the Apollo command and service module did not require retrorockets to return the command module to Earth, as the flight path took the module through the atmosphere, using atmospheric drag to reduce velocity. The test flights in Earth orbit required retrograde propulsion, which was provided by the large Service Propulsion Engine on the service module. The same engine was used as a retrorocket to slow the spacecraft for lunar orbit insertion. The Apollo Lunar Module used its descent stage engine to drop from orbit and land on the Moon. Retrorockets were used to back the S-IC and S-II stages off from the rest of the vehicle after their respective shutdowns during the Saturn V's launch to Earth parking orbit. Space Shuttle program[edit] The Space Shuttle Orbital maneuvering system provided the vehicle with a pair of powerful liquid-fueled rockets for both reentry and orbital maneuvering. One was sufficient for a successful reentry, and if both systems were to fail, the reaction control system could slow the vehicle enough for reentry. Landers[edit] Retrorockets are also used in landing spacecraft on other astronomical bodies, such as the Moon and Mars, as well as enabling a spacecraft to enter an orbit around such a body, when otherwise it would scoot past and off into space again.

Many of these projects were not realized in his lifetime, and none of the planetary probes performed a completely successful mission until after his death. Human spaceflightEdit Although he was having ideas since 1948, Korolev's planning for the piloted mission began in 1958 with design studies for the future Vostok spacecraft. It was to hold a single passenger in a space suit, and be fully automated. The space suit, unlike the United States' pure oxygen system, was 80 percent nitrogen and only 20 percent oxygen.[22] The capsule had an escape mechanism for problems prior to launch, and a soft-landing and ejection system during the recovery. The spacecraft was spherical, just like the Sputnik design, and Korolev explained his reasoning for this by saying \"the spherical shape would be more stable dynamically\".[22] Beginning with work on the Vostok, Konstantin Feoktistov was recruited directly by Korolev to be the principal designer for manned spaceflight vehicles.[22] On 15 May 1960 an unmanned prototype performed 64 orbits of the Earth, but the reentry maneuver failed. On 28 July 1960, two dogs by the names of Chaika and Lishichka were launched into space, but the mission was unsuccessful when an explosion killed the dogs.

Unlike Mercury, the retrorockets, electrical power, propulsion systems, oxygen, and water were located in a detachable Adapter Module behind the Reentry Module. A major design improvement in Gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components, which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary, without removing or disturbing other already tested components. Unablated Gemini heat shield Ablated Gemini heat shield Reentry module Many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors. Unlike Mercury, Gemini used completely solid-state electronics, and its modular design made it easy to repair.[12] Gemini's emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket, but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats. The tower was heavy and complicated, and NASA engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the Titan II's hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact. A Titan II booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled Atlas and Saturn.
