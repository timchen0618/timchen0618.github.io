It is important for you to know this because it can be the difference between merely keeping them alive and preventing long-term scarring and infection. \u00b7 Second-degree burns, otherwise called partial thickness burns, usually involve both the outer skin layers and the layers underneath. These typically have all the attributes of the first-degree burns and then blistering. This is usually more painful than the first and can result in skin discoloration temporarily or permanently. \u00b7 Third-degree burns, otherwise referred to as full thickness, burns often involve the outer and deeper skin layers. These often result in blackened, disfigured and extensively scarred skin. While most first-degree burns may fall into the category of mild or moderate burns which typically don\u2019t cause much damage, the second and third-degree burns tend to be severe particularly when the significant areas of the body are involved. There are quite a few treatment options when it comes to burn care and treatment. The following should serve as decent guides for you. If in the kitchen, run some cool water on the burn, dip the part in cold water, or wrap a towel soaked in cool water around the area. This should help prevent blistering and swelling.

Second degree burns typically blister and involve damage to both the entire epidermis and the upper layers of the dermis. The wound from the burn will be pink or red in color, painful and will appear wet. Second degree burns can also be red or white in appearance and involve the destruction of both the epidermis and most of the dermis. Sensation may also be diminished in the affected area. Third degree burns involve the destruction of all layers of the skin and the damage extends to subcutaneous tissues. The burned area may appear black, white or leathery in texture and will be dry. Patients with third degree burns often do not feel pain in the affected area. Cool the burn using cool, sterile water or saline solution. You can also cover the area with a cool, wet cloth until the burning stops. For a major burn, seek medical attention. Burns that occur where skin consistently rubs against skin, such as the knee, elbow, wrist or fingers, or burns on the face should be treated by a physician.

If you use running water to cool the injured part, ensure the water is not so forceful that blisters on the burned skin are broken. 2. Elevate the burned part. 3. Ensure the victim drinks plenty of liquids to avoid dehydration. 4. Seek medical treatment for second-degree burns to the face, hands, feet, or genitals, or that are more than two to three inches in diameter. For extensive second-degree burns, monitor the victim for signs of shock and treat accordingly until he/she receives medical treatment. See Lesson 4 for signs and treatment of shock. For second-degree burns to the face, especially if accompanied by smoke inhalation, the victim may have respiratory burns that can lead to swelling and blockage of his/her airway. Monitor the victims breathing and treat accordingly until he/she receives medical treatment. Treating Third-Degree Burns To treat third-degree burns, follow these steps: 1.

When you have minor burns and feel the pain, you should let your affected skin areas under the running cold water immediately within a couple of minutes. Alternatively, you can utilize a cold compress for treating minor burns. For a satisfactory result, you should repeat this treatment every few hours. The cold temperature can relieve the discomfort and pain caused by burns. However, unlike other skin damages, you should not use ice for the cold compress. This is because it can damage delicate tissues. Do not use this treatment for second and third-degree burns.

Burns may be caused by heat, flame, hot liquids or metals, steam or hot water, sun, chemicals or electricity. House fires are a major hazard for children of all ages. You can prepare yourself by learning basic first aid steps to deal with a burn injury. In this guide, we\u2019ll discuss the classification of burns in children and the correct first aid treatment for a child with burns. Burns are classified and treated according to the degree and extent of tissue damage and the type of agent responsible. Burns to the face, neck, crotch, feet, and joints are generally more serious than other burns. First-degree burns are minor, affecting only the outer layer of skin (epidermis). They may cause pain, reddening and mild swelling, but they do not produce blisters. Second-degree burns involve both the epidermis and underlying dermis layers of skin, resulting in blistering and oozing in addition to pain, reddening, and swelling. Third-degree burns are the most serious, destroying all the layers of skin and damaging underlying tissue, including nerves. In most instances of third-degree burns, there is no pain because the nerves have been destroyed. The burned area may appear white or blackened due to charring, and the underlying muscle or other tissue is exposed. Call for immediate emergency help. Keep the child calm and lying down until emergency help arrives. Chemical burns can be caused by either acidic or alkaline substances.

Avoid sun exposure to this area as the sun may actually worsen the appearance. third and fourth degree burns-while a prolonged course of therapy may not be ascertained initially, certain aspects of treatment should be started immediately in an effort to relieve pain and prevent further burn destruction. This would include elevation of the limb in an effort to reduce swelling and the rush of blood to the foot which may further increase pain. Cooling of the involved area should also be started immediately. This is done not with ice but instead with luke warm water compresses (approximately 77 degrees F). At this point, again, depending on the severity of the burn, medical attention may be required. The first thing medical personnel will look at is the circulatory status of the foot. Excessive formation of edema after the injury can cause impaired circulation of blood flow into the foot and in severe cases may lead to tissue death (gangrene). Prophylactic antibiotics may also be started immediately in an effort to prevent the burn area from becoming infected.

Most domestic burns or scalds happen in the kitchen and are associated with cooking activities. These are activities wherein we are surrounded by hot objects like pots, pans or griddle and hot liquids like oil, water, broth and even steam. The bathroom and dining area can also be places where kids and adults can suffer from scalds or burns especially when you don\u2019t test your bath water first before jumping in, or test your soup and hot beverage before sipping.

When the first layer of skin has been burned through and the second layer of skin (dermis) also is burned, the injury is termed a second-degree burn. Blisters develop and the skin takes on an intensely reddened, splotchy appearance. Second-degree burns produce severe pain and swelling. The most serious burns are painless and involve all layers of the skin. Fat, muscle and every bone may be affected. Areas may be charred black or appear dry and white. Difficulty inhaling and exhaling, carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic effects may occur if smoke inhalation accompanies the burn. Cool the burn. Hold the burned area under cold running water for at least 5 minutes, or until the pain subsides. If this is impractical, immerse the burn in cold water or cool it with cold compresses.

First-degree burn is the least serious of burns and are those in which only the outer layer of skin is burned, but not all the way through. An accidental touch to the stove or curling iron can result in a minor burn. The skin is usually red, often there is swelling, and pain sometimes is present.

Second-degree burn is when the first layer of skin has been burned through and the second layer of skin (dermis) also is burned. In second degree burns blisters develop, skin takes on an intensely reddened splotchy appearance, and there is severe pain and swelling. If the second-degree burn is no larger than 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter, treat it as a minor burn.

If medics are to follow the guideline below, and use the Handbook to the best of their advantage, the outcome will soon aid you on your travels into becoming a successful, and consistent medic. Firstly, determine the severity of the burn; whether it be first, second or third degree. Once you have determined the severity of the burn, you must act appropriately. Tell the patient to remain calm and be sure you know what you're doing. Dealing with first and second degree burns is simple; reach into your first-aid kit and remove some Aloe-Vera gel. Apply the gel to the burn and if second degree, perscribe some gel for the patient. Dealing with a third degree burn is slightly more complicated; for this you must rush the patient to hospital, where a skin graft must be performed. To perform the Skin Graft, simply hook the patient up to an IV Connector, applying 15mg of Morphine per hour, immediately apply disinfectant to the burnt area and measure how much surface area it is covering. Once calculated, choose an appropriate location of which skin is going to be removed (The bottom, and ribs are good places). Measure out a new surface area, making sure it will be"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "To distinguish a minor burn from a serious burn, the first step is to determine the extent of damage to body tissues. The three burn classifications of first-degree burn, second-degree burn and third-degree burn will help you determine emergency care. First-degree burn is the least serious of burns and are those in which only the outer layer of skin is burned, but not all the way through. An accidental touch to the stove or curling iron can result in a minor burn. The skin is usually red, often there is swelling, and pain sometimes is present. Treat a first-degree burn as a minor burn unless it involves substantial portions of the hands, feet, face, groin or buttocks, or a major joint, which requires emergency medical attention. Second-degree burn is when the first layer of skin has been burned through and the second layer of skin (dermis) also is burned. In second degree burns blisters develop, skin takes on an intensely reddened splotchy appearance, and there is severe pain and swelling. If the second-degree burn is no larger than 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter, treat it as a minor burn. If the burned area is larger or if the burn is on the hands, feet, face, groin or buttocks, or over a major joint, treat it as a major burn and get medical help immediately. Treatment for minor burns includes: cooling the burn, covering the burn with sterile gauze, and pain relief. A topical cream silver sulfadiazine may be used to treat minor burns and works"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "rather than electric, toothbrush temporarily. Refraining from wearing a mouth guard until the area has healed. Avoiding picking at loose skin. It will come away from the roof of the mouth eventually. Prematurely removing the skin can irritate the area and lead to infection. Avoiding hot drinks until the burn has healed. A burn on the roof of the mouth will usually heal within 2 weeks. A person can treat most burns on the roof of the mouth at home. Over-the-counter painkillers can help to reduce inflammation and pain. An individual may have a first-, second-, or third-degree burn, and they are most likely to have a first-degree burn on the roof of the mouth. People with second- or third-degree burns should seek urgent medical attention. Clear blisters and weeping skin characterize second-degree burns. Third-degree burns destroy every layer of skin, and the area will be dark brown. Burns can be more severe in infants and older adults. They are more likely to need medical attention and treatment. If a burn on the roof of the mouth has not healed within 2 weeks, it may be a good idea to see a doctor. Being aware of foods that hold heat for long periods can help to prevent burns. Oils, fats, and liquids can reach and hold very high temperatures. Waiting until foods and drinks have cooled and can prevent burns on the roof of the mouth.

Second-degree burns have similar symptoms, but with the addition of blistering. Third-degree burns will leave the flesh charred black or white, and maybe numb. Third-degree burns warrant medical attention. Determine the severity (degree) of the burn. Get medical attention for serious third-degree burns. Gently pour cool water over the fingers, or soak them in cool water. You may also apply a cool, wet cloth. Apply a dry clean bandage or dressing to the fingers, separately for each finger that is burned. After the skin is cooled, you may apply some lotion, but only if the burn is not severe.

In 2011, 2,640 people (not counting firefighters) died in fires and another 13,350 were injured, although more people were injured by smoke and toxic gases in fires than by burns. The principal cause of deaths related to fire is the smoke, while cooking is the most common source of home fires. More home fires occur during the winter, and the 37% of home fire injuries occur in residencies that do not have smoke alarm. Additionally, fire and burn injuries cost approximately $7.5 billion every year. Different Type of Burns In a personal injury case, burns are classified into four different categories according to their severity: First Degree Burn First-degree burns are the least severe, but they can still be very painful. They usually cause swelling and redness and only affect the outer layers of the skin, which is called epidermis. Most sunburn falls into this category. This type of burns can be considerate serious if it occurs in a part of the body that is particularly vulnerable. If this type of burn deserves a settlement, the agreement is likely to be low.

The severity of burns is rated on a three-step scale based on how badly the burn damages skin and tissue: First-degree burns are comparable to sunburn, perhaps even bad sunburn, and affect only the top layer of skin. Second-degree burns can cause blistering and skin damage that goes deeper than the surface layer of skin and, if severe enough, can cause scarring. Third-degree burns cause deep damage to the skin and underlying fat. Third-degree burns are the worst of burns and can be quite severe. Particularly when it comes to severe third-degree burns, numerous complications can add to the physical and financial consequences of a burn injury. Burn injuries are painful, but that also can result in significant scarring and disfigurement. Other top complications that can arise from burn injuries can include permanent skin damage resulting in fragile skin or skin breakdown, which can increase susceptibility to skin injuries from relatively minor causes in the future, psychological complications, infections, pneumonia, organ failure, chronic pain, and skin graft failures.

Burns can happen at home, on the job, because of a motor vehicle accident, and even while in nature (i.e. a campfire gets out of control, a person is struck by lightning, etc.). While some burns, including burns occurring because of natural phenomena, are unpredictable and unpreventable, most burn injuries can be avoided. For example, a workplace electrical burn injury may be the result of improper wiring or a lack of thorough worker training, or a home burn injury from a fire may have never occurred but for the lack of properly functioning smoke detectors.

These burns may cause blistering, and some can result in skin grafts or scarring. It usually takes several weeks for second-degree burn injuries to heal.

When an accident does happen, burn injuries are one of the most common injury types. There are three primary categories of burn injuries that a motorcyclist can sustain in the event of a crash. These are first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree burns. All three types can be caused by fire or scalding hot liquids, both of which are possible in a motorcycle crash.

The second-degree classification sees damage beyond the top layer of skin. Third-degree burns, however, are by far the most severe injury of the three. A third-degree burn not only destroys all layers of the skin and nerve endings, but can also potentially cause damage to bones and organs too.

Second degree burns, also referred to as partial thickness burns, are a tad more severe because they damage part of the lower dermis layer of skin. These types of burns blister and swill and are extremely painful. Lastly, third degree burns, or full thickness burns, can cause permanent nerve damage because the outer epidermis and lower dermis layer of skin is destroyed. Third degree burns could leave the skin discolored with a leathery texture. Looking for an attorney for your burn injury case in Walker County?

This is very good news as burn injuries are among the most painful type of personal injury a victim can suffer. Further, they can also result in death due to secondary infections. The reason there is such a high risk of secondary infections is because your skin is the best way to prevent infection, as it serves a barrier to harmful microbes. After a serious burn injury, there is no skin to protect the body from this harmful bacteria. In addition to the risk of serious infections, there is a lot of pain and suffering associated with burn injuries because of the nerve damage which often occurs when the skin is destroyed. It should also be noted, there are different degrees of burns, as most people are aware, but many are not aware that there is also what is known as fourth-degree burn. A first-degree burn is the least serious and is typically the result of a sunburn, for example. A second-degree burn involves redness and blistering, and a third-degree burn involves the destruction of all layers of skin and some of the muscle tissue under the skin. A fourth-degree burn is by far the worst type of burn injury and is often deadly.

When an accident does happen, burn injuries are one of the most common injury types. There are three primary categories of burn injuries that a motorcyclist can sustain in the event of a crash. These are first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree burns. All three types can be caused by fire or scalding hot liquids, both of which are possible in a motorcycle crash. First-degree burns are the least severe type of burn, and usually heal quickly on their own or with minor treatment. Second-degree burns are slightly more severe. The second-degree classification sees damage beyond the top layer of skin. Third-degree burns, however, are by far the most severe injury of the three. A third-degree burn not only destroys all layers of the skin and nerve endings, but can also potentially cause damage to bones and organs too. Another type of \u2018burn\u2019 injury that motorcyclists often experience when in a motorcycle accident is a road burn injury. A road burn injury, also called road rash, results when the skin drags across the pavement at a high rate of speed. A minor case of road burn can resemble a rash, hence its name. But don\u2019t let that fool you. Bikers who skid across the road going 55 miles per hour and higher will see much more than a rash.

Motor vehicle-related burns fall into one of four categories, with first-degree burns being the least serious and fourth-degree burns being potentially life-threatening. First-degree burns are minor and cause damage to the outer layer of skin. The skin appears red, slightly swollen and may be painful. First-degree burns are likely to heal within a few days. Second-degree burns are moderate to severe burns, causing damage to both layers of skin. Second-degree burns cause the skin to appear swollen and red and also cause blistering of the affected area. Scarring is also possible once a second-degree burn has healed which may take 2-3 weeks or longer. Third-degree burns (full thickness burns) happen when the burn goes through the layers of the skin and causes scarring. The burn affects the layer of fat underneath the dermis, can damage nerve endings, causing numbness, and the skin may appear leathery and white. Third-degree burns require proper cleansing, administration of IV fluids, antibiotics, and possible skin grafts or artificial skin.

There are two steps to how those optional fields are filled in. First, the second parameter to the mapping() method is a reference to a native class. That native class must have a default constructor. Whatever value the default constructor initially sets for an optional field will be that field's value. Second, the mapOptional() method has an optional third parameter. If provided it is the value that mapOptional() should set that field to if the YAML document does not have that key. There is one important difference between those two ways (default constructor and third parameter to mapOptional). When YAML I/O generates a YAML document, if the mapOptional() third parameter is used, if the actual value being written is the same as (using ==) the default value, then that key/value is not written. Order of Keys -------------- When writing out a YAML document, the keys are written in the order that the calls to mapRequired()/mapOptional() are made in the mapping() method.

Materialist The materialist school of mediatization theory is studying how society to an increasing degree becomes dependent on the media and their logic. The studies are combining results from different areas of science to describe how changes in the media and changes in society are interrelated. In particular, they are focusing on how the political processes in western democracies are changing through mediatization. The mediatization of politics can be characterized by four different dimensions, according to the Swedish professor of political communication Jesper Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck and the Swiss professor of media research Frank Esser: The first dimension refers to the degree to which the media constitute the most important source of information about politics and society. The second dimension refers to the degree to which the media have become independent from other political and social institutions. The third dimension refers to the degree to which media content and the coverage of politics and current affairs is guided by media logic rather than political logic. This dimension deals with the extent to which the media\u2019s own needs and standards of newsworthiness, rather than those of political actors or institutions, are decisive for what the media cover and how they cover it. The fourth dimension refers to the extent to which political institutions, organizations, and actors are guided by either media logic or political logic.

Examples are from Bradshaw & Czobor (2005:30) Relative clauses Relative clauses are created by use of the demonstrative pronouns/adjectives, which come in several forms themselves. The three series above represent three degrees of proximity in the demonstratives. First series correlates to something nearest or most relevant to the 1st person (the speaker), and the second series corresponded to the 2nd person (addressee), while the third series corresponds to what is nearest or most relevant to the 3rd person (non-speech act participant). The forms beginning with t- are those that offer a specific or precise degree of evidentiality (with regard to the referent). Examples of this degree of precision can be seen below. The bolded forms in the above table are the short forms of these demonstratives. They are phonologically reduced but carry no difference in meaning from the long forms. It is these short demonstratives that are used to create relative clauses. The three degrees of proximity as well as the two degrees of evidential precision still come into play when these forms are used as relative pronouns.

If the skandhas appropriate themselves, that leads to a vicious cycle of infinite regress. Hence, the V\u0101ts\u012bputr\u012bya argue, the nominal person (pudgala) is neither the same as nor different from the skandhas. It is a heuristic fiction that avoids these unwarranted consequences and lends coherence by also corresponding to how actual persons experience themselves\u2014that is, as distinct individuals continuous with, but not absolutely identical to or reducible to, their own pasts and futures.Lusthaus also explains their reasoning for the second and third designations as follows:But what remains constant or continuous between such [past and future] lives?

If the same, then their real discontinuities are ignored, leading to a form of eternalism, another impermissible view for Buddhists.

The work was written between 1821 and 1822. Like other late period sonatas, it contains fugal elements. It was dedicated to his friend, pupil, and patron, Archduke Rudolf. The sonata consists of only two contrasting movements. The second movement is marked as an arietta with variations. Thomas Mann called it \"farewell to the sonata form\". The work entered the repertoire of leading pianists only in the second half of the 19th century. Rhythmically visionary and technically demanding, it is one of the most discussed of Beethoven's works. History Beethoven conceived of the plan for his final three piano sonatas (Op. 109, 110 and 111) during the summer of 1820, while he worked on his Missa solemnis. Although the work was only seriously outlined by 1819, the famous first theme of the allegro ed appassionato was found in a draft book dating from 1801 to 1802, contemporary to his Second Symphony. Moreover, the study of these draft books implies that Beethoven initially had plans for a sonata in three movements, quite different from that which we know: it is only thereafter that the initial theme of the first movement became that of the String Quartet No. 13, and that what should have been used as the theme with the adagio\u2014a slow melody in A\u2014was abandoned.

There are six main stages that sintering processes can be grouped in which may overlap with one another: 1 initial bonding among particles, 2) neck growth, 3) pore channel closure, 4) pore rounding, 5) densification or pore shrinkage, and 6) pore coarsening. The main mechanisms present in these stages are evaporation, condensation, grain boundaries, volume diffusion, and plastic deformation. Most sintering furnaces contain three zones with three different properties that help to carry out the six steps above. The first zone, commonly coined the burn-off or purge stage, is designed to combust air, burn any contaminants such as lubricant or binders, and slowly raise the temperature of the compact materials. If the temperature of the compact parts is raised too quickly, the air in the pores will be at a very high internal pressure which could lead to expansion or fracture of the part. The second zone, known as the high-temperature stage, is used to produce solid-state diffusion and particle bonding. The material is seeking to lower its surface energy and does so by moving toward the points of contact between particles. The contact points become larger and eventually a solid mass with small pores is created. The third zone, also called the cooling period, is used to cool down the parts while still in a controlled atmosphere. This is an important zone as it prevents oxidation from immediate contact with the air or a phenomenon known as rapid cooling.

Schumann comfortably won the silver while McNally fell back during the final with a 47 and a 46, finishing seventh and giving way to a third-place tie between Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs and Alberto Sevieri, resolved in Kov\u00e1cs's favour on grounds of higher final score. The bronze was Hungary's first rapid fire pistol since 1952. There were 32 competitors from 23 nations. Each nation had been limited to two shooters since the 1952 Games.

It addresses the questions what understanding of security does society create and conversely, what society does security establish. In other words, sociology of security is the study of mutual interactions between security and the society that result in developing or production and reproduction of security in the society. The answer to the question \"what is the Sociology of Security?\" can be discussed from two viewpoints. The first says that the Sociology of Security addresses the \"understanding of security\", so it asks: What kind of understanding of security does the society provide? Based on what elements does society formulate the security? How does society organize the stable and fragile society? How much does the society want to institutionalize the security? How do distinctions and differences between security and insecurity form and reproduce in society? On the other hand, because the aim of Sociology of Security is to study mutual interaction between society and security, the second viewpoint asks: What kind of society does the security form? What are the benefits and barriers of security for the society? What type of interactions does security provide in different environments (urban / rural\u2026) in various situations (parties / union...) in different groups (family / friends...)?

There isn't just one way to structure a talk, but it's important that I structure it somehow. Jumping directly to details is a really easy way to lose my audience before I've even gotten to the third slide. I generally structure my talks in this format: - A story relevant to my message. - The agenda, usually three points. - Those three points. - Conclusion, which ties back to the story at the beginning. Sometimes I have only two points, and sometimes four (if one is small). The points are essentially the answer to \"what the audience needs to hear\" from the focus step. Even talks about programming need structure. ## Design So, design. This is the part that people usually skip directly to, but design is useless without a profile, focus, and structure. Actually, no \u2013 design can be _worse than useless_ without sufficient forethought. Designing slides first can actually _harm_ the ability to convey a message, by distracting the audience.

In practice the first point is often not used when classifying a supernova and instead an alternate spectroscopic characteristic is used: 1.

Despite the fact that this classification scheme is not based on what the supernova really *is*, it so happens that Type Ia supernovae are physically quite different from other kinds of supernova, which are collectively referred to as core-collapse supernovae. Although there are many open questions about core-collapse supernovae, the basic picture is that core collapse supernovae occur when massive stars (at least 8 $$M_{\\odot}$$ or so) run out of nuclear fuel to burn at the end of their lives. Type Ia supernovae are a completely different kind of phenomenon. What we do know from the spectroscopic properties and the shape of the light curve is that Type Ia supernovae are exploding white dwarfs. Most white dwarfs are made principally of carbon and oxygen, and if the density of the white dwarf gets large enough, the carbon and oxgyen can be made to undergo a runaway thermonuclear reaction. In this reaction, the carbon and oxygen of the white dwarf burns all the way to $$^{56}$$Ni, which is an unstable isotope with a half-life of 9 days. The $$^{56}$$Ni then decays to $$^{56}$$Co, which is also unstable with a half-life of 114 days. The $$^{56}$$Co then decays to $$^{56}$$Fe, which is stable.

The pillar structure of the EU allowed the areas of European co-operation to be increased without leaders handing a large amount of power to supranational institutions. The pillar system segregated the EU. What were formerly the competencies of the EEC fell within the European Communities pillar. Justice and Home Affairs was introduced as a new pillar while European Political Cooperation became the second pillar (the Common Foreign and Security Policy). The Communities institutions became the institutions of the EU but the roles of the institutions between the pillars are different. The commission, Parliament and Court of Justice are largely cut out of activities in the second and third pillars, with the Council dominating proceedings. This is reflected in the names of the institutions, the council is formally the \"Council of the European Union\" while the commission is formally the \"Commission of the European Communities\". This allowed the new areas to be based on intergovernmentalism (unanimous agreement between governments) rather than majority voting and independent institutions according to supranational democracy.

A view's position in a RecyclerView's layout is definitely different from its position in the adapter attached to it. But we're addressing another subtile topic: the difference between [RecyclerView.ViewHolder](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder)'s [`getLayoutPosition`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder#getlayoutposition) method and its [`getAdapterPosition`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html#getAdapterPosition()) method. ## Motivations Quoting from the Android documentation of `RecyclerView.ViewHolder#getAdapterPosition()` method > Note that this might be different than the getLayoutPosition() if there are pending adapter updates but a new layout pass has not happened yet. \"Fine, now it's clear to me that this method is different from RecyclerView's `getLayoutPosition()` method. \", that's what occurred to me the first time I read that doc. That being thought, I would still ponder about which between the two to choose from, when required to find a RecyclerView child view's position given a reference to that view. And my solution has eventually become \"using neither of the two\", because there's a third solution, namely to rely on `LayoutManager`'s [`getPosition`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.LayoutManager#getposition) method. It's worth noting that no magic is going on here, as its implementation is simply redirecting to `getLayoutPosition()`: ```java public int getPosition(View view) { return ((RecyclerView.LayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams()).getViewLayoutPosition(); } ``` I thought it was no big deal until the following happened. ## The messed-up margins The symptom, in one line, is that RecyclerView item decorations are messed up after child items got swapped.

Some of the longest roots are five or six syllables, like /mamantakarman/, which means 'land crab.' Yimas has predictable rules with regard to syllabification. In the middle of a word, if a consonant is between two vowels, the syllable boundary precedes the consonant: (V.CV). If two consonants are between two vowels, the syllable boundary falls between the consonants: (VC1.C2V). However, if C1 is a stop and C2 is /r/, the syllable boundary precedes C1: (V.C1C2V). Whenever three consonants are between two vowels, the syllable boundary comes after the first consonant: (VC1.C2C3V). Stress In Yimas, the primary accent lies in general on the first syllable of a word. In words with more than three syllables, the third syllable carries secondary stress. Below are some examples (where \u00b4 represents primary stress, and ` represents secondary stress): If the first syllable contains an epenthetic vowel but the second does not, then the second syllable is stressed. When the first as well as the second syllable contain epenthetic vowels, then the stress lies on the first syllable. Below are more examples, including words with stress on epenthetic vowels: The genitive suffix -na, which is used on personal pronouns, takes primary stress: ama-na-kn 'mine'.

I am given a choice of downloading my images and music with either MP4 480p and DVD ISO. What are the differences?Also, is there a difference in quality between the two? A: You want DVD ISO. A \"proper\" DVD uses MPEG2 - so MP4 will not be playable on \"DVD only\" players, where a DVD ISO will. I don't believe you can make a call as to which will provide better performance. MP4 will typically make much smaller files (or better quality video) for the same file size, although 480p is not a very big standard. That said, if you don't have that much content you can proabably get similar quality images out of each format, ie if you have way less then 1 disks worth of information at ISO DVD quality and you increase the bit rate (if its an option), you can land up with just as high a quality output - the only disadvantage will be working with larger files and thus longer disk burn times.

How Burns Are Classified By Severity There are four classifications of burn severity, including: First degree burns \u2013 First degree burns are the mildest type of burn and typically result in light epidermal damage and redness, but do not blister the skin. Second degree burns \u2013 Second degree burns cause damage to both the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the lower layer (dermis). Second-degree burns usually result in swelling and blistering, as well as redness at the site and pain. Third degree burns \u2013 These burns involve extensive damage to both the outer and lower layer of skin, as well as damage to the underlying tissue and bone. Third degree burns often result in white or blackened skin and severe pain. Fourth degree burns \u2013 Fourth degree burns are the most severe type of burn and are usually fatal. They extend through the skin and into muscle and bone. The amount of the body which ends up being burned also dictates the severity and how doctors will go about treatment. A minor burn means that less than 10% of the body is burned in an adult, and less than 5% for a young or elderly person. A major burn is more than 20% of the body in an adult, and 10-20% for a young or elderly person.

First-degree burns are mild, resulting in redness and pain, and can be treated with over-the-counter pain medication and skin care products, such as aloe vera cream. Second-Degree Burns: This type of burn damages the first two layers of skin. These burns can be superficial or deep, depending on the severity of the burn. Second-degree burns result in pain, redness, swelling, and blistering, and can be treated with antibiotic creams prescribed by a doctor. Third-Degree Burns: These burns affect all the layers of skin and the tissue under it. These burns are severe and require medical treatment. White, blackened, or charred skin may result from these burns. Third-degree burns are treated with skin grafting or synthetic skin. Intravenous fluids and antibiotics might also be necessary. Fourth-Degree Burns: The most severe variety, fourth-degree burns penetrate the bone, muscles, and ligaments. This type of burn requires medical treatment similar to that of third-degree burns. Two types of burns are common in the workplace: heat burns and chemical burns. Heat burns occur when the skin comes in contact with a surface or a substance of high temperature. Heat burns can be caused by flames, hot surfaces, hot liquids, or steam.

Never try to treat fourth degree burns on your own by using ice or cool water. Note: The classification of burns by degree is split into two theories. Some authorities use only three degrees of severity while others use four. On the three degree scale, burns that reach as deep as the muscle and bone are classified as third degree burns. The distinctions between first and second degree burns are the same under both systems. If you have been diagnosed with a third degree burn, it is helpful to find out whether your medical provider uses the three or four degree classification. This distinction will help you determine the extent of the damage to the subcutaneous tissues that have been damaged along with the skin. In addition to the 3 or 4 degrees used to label the severity of the injury, burns may also be categorized based on how they occurred. Chemical burns, sometimes referred to as caustic burns, are caused by contact with an irritant such as an acid or base. The caustic substance is usually an industrial or household cleaner, but natural substances like spicy peppers can cause burns as well. Chemical burns can cause a reaction with the skin or internally, if swallowed or inhaled. Internal burns can cause permanent damage to the internal organs and require immediate treatment.

Mild sunburn is an example. \u2022 Second-degree burns involve the epidermis and part of the dermis layer of skin. The burn site appears red, blistered, and may be swollen and painful. \u2022 Third-degree burns may also damage the underlying bones, muscles, and tendons. The burn site appears white or charred. There is no sensation in the area since the nerve endings are destroyed. For many years, healthcare providers have also added a fourth-degree category. Using this system, third-degree burns are limited to those that extend down through the epidermis and dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, and fourth-degree describes the burns that extend down into the underlying muscles, tendons and ligaments. Recently, a new system has come into use. This new system completely abandons the old use of degrees and describes the injuries based specifically by the depth of the burn. The traditional classification of burns is being replaced by the designations of superficial, superficial partial thickness, deep partial thickness and full thickness.

Here is how burns are categorized: First degree burns, also known as superficial burns, affect the outer layer of skin called the epidermis. Mild sunburn, which includes painful reddened skin, is a common type of 1st-degree burn. It usually does not cause long-term tissue damage.

Second-degree burns may lead to blistering, are extremely painful, and can leave permanent scarring. Third-degree burns are particularly tragic, as these burns reach below the skin to the layer of fat, even burning nerve endings in many cases, making these burns much more severe, but often less painful than second-degree burns.

Third-degree burns are particularly tragic, as these burns reach below the skin to the layer of fat, even burning nerve endings in many cases, making these burns much more severe, but often less painful than second-degree burns. Third-degree burns are often associated with other complications, such as difficulty breathing and damage to the lungs due to smoke inhalation. The Effects of a Burn Injury A burn injury is extremely serious, and can have lasting effects on a patient\u2019s life. One of the most psychologically challenging parts of such an experience is that it can be very disfiguring. In addition to serious scarring, which may require multiple plastic surgeries to improve, a person who has suffered a serious burn injury may also be at risk of infection and sepsis, low blood volume, dangerously low body temperature, respiratory complications, and bone and joint problems. If a burn is very serious, it may mean that a limb must be amputated. In addition to being physically painful, these injuries are often expensive to treat.

The practice of classifying burns in \u2018degrees\u2019 was introduced in the 18th century. Two German surgeons, Heister (1724) and Richter (1788) classified burns into four degrees: First degree: Heat, pain and small blisters. Second degree: Severe pain and large blisters. Third degree: Damage to the skin and underlying flesh, with crust formation. Fourth degree: Damage to all soft tissues down to the bone. In 19th century, Guillaume Dupuytren developed a classification of burn depth after a review of the care of 50 patients. This classification divided burns into the following six degrees: First degree: Erythema. Second degree: Skin inflammation with epidermal detachment. Third degree: Partial destruction of the papillary layer and subpapillary network of the corium. Fourth degree: Destruction of the skin down to the subcuticular layer. Fifth degree: Crust formation over skin and muscle. Dupuytren\u2019s classification is still in use by some today.[39] However many modern writings tend to use a simpler three degree classification system and this may be attributed to a French surgeon, Boyer, and was introduced in the beginning of the 18th century (1814).[40] This classification divided burns into the following three degrees: Second degree: Blistering of the skin leading to superficial ulceration. Third degree: Tissue disorganization leading to a dry yellow crust. The current convention for describing burns is using depth rather than degrees; that is superficial, mixed depth and full thickness and new techniques are now in development to help physicians determine the depth of burns more accurately and objectively.

Second-degree burns are more serious and extend into the outer epidermis layer and the lower layer of skin (the dermis). You might receive a second-degree burn from accidentally pouring boiling water onto your body or touching a hot clothes iron. In addition to pain and redness, most second-degree burns cause blistering and swelling. Third-degree burns are among the most severe burns. They burn all the way through the epidermis and dermis skin layers and damage the tissue underneath. Skin may turn white or blackened and charred and it may go numb if nerves were damaged. Most severe burn injuries that result in lawsuits, such as those from fires or electrical shocks, are third-degree burns. Some medical professionals also use additional categories \u2013 up to the sixth degree \u2013 to indicate injuries that burn down into ligaments, tendons, muscles, bones, or internal organs. Third-degree burns and worse, especially if they cover a significant percentage of the body, can lead to a range of complications and may require extended hospitalization and skin-graft surgeries. If the burn damages muscle and other interior tissue, patients may require physical therapy to regain range of motion. Because of extensive nerve damage, burns at these levels can cause chronic pain.

Light burns: A person can experience these types of burns by coming into contact with either sunlight or ultraviolet light. Radiation burns: Exposure to nuclear radiation can cause burns of this nature. Thermal burns: These burns are caused by contact with extreme heat including fire, hot liquids, and steam.

Burns are categorized into three degrees depending on severity. First degree burns are the least serious type of burns that occur when a burn is limited to only the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin. Second degrees occur when the epidermis has been completely burned through and the dermis, the second layer of skin, has also been burned.

A burn is the effect of dry heat applied to some part of the human body, a scald being the result of moist heat. Clinically there is no distinction between the two, and their classification and treatment are identical. In Dupuytren's classification, now most generally accepted, burns are divided into six classes according to the severest part of the lesion. Burns of the first degree are characterized by severe pain, redness of the skin, a certain amount of swelling that soon passes, and later exfoliation of the skin. Burns of the second degree show vesicles (small blisters) scattered over the inflamed area, and containing a clear, yellowish fluid. Beneath the vesicle the highly sensitive papillae of the skin are exposed. Burns of this degree leave no scar, but often produce a permanent discoloration. In burns of the third degree, there is a partial destruction of the true skin, leaving sloughs of a yellowish or black colour. The pain is at first intense, but passes off on about the second day to return again at the end of a week, when the sloughs separate, exposing the sensitive nerve filaments of the underlying skin. This results in a slightly depressed cicatrix, which happily, however, shows but slight tendency to contraction.

Second Degree Burns Second degree burns affect the first and second layers of skin. Second degree burns cause skin to be red, white or splotchy, and the skin can blister or appear moist. Third Degree Burns Third degree burns affect both layers of skin, the fat layer below them, and nerves, causing skin to take on a waxy, leathery, or charred appearance. Fourth Degree Burns The fourth degree burn classification is not always used, but when it is, it refers to the loss of muscle and even bone. In some cases, a fourth-degree burn is so severe that the person loses a limb. Chemical Burns People can also suffer from chemical burns from alkalis and acids in the smoke from a fire or explosion. These chemicals can damage the skin, eyes, larynx, lungs, and other areas. As with thermal burns, these injuries can be fatal. When chemicals are a possible source or contributing factor in an explosion, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) usually sends a team to investigate. This was done for the Didion Mill explosion in Cambria, Wisconsin, the Loy Lange Box Company blast, and the Husky Energy oil refinery explosion in Superior, WI, where CSB investigators determined that the blast originated in the fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU).

Burns are commonly defined as being tissue damage that is caused by heat, exposure to radiation, chemicals or electrical currents. The severity of a burn injury can vary significantly and can depend on how deep the tissue damage is, how extensive the area of the burns are and what parts of the body are burnt. Second degree burns are burns that affect both the epidermis and the dermis or second layer of skin. These burns can cause swelling and skin discoloration. Second degree burns can cause extreme pain which is often intensified by significant blistering of the skin. Second degree burns often cause scarring. Third degree burns penetrate through to the fat layer beneath the skin and can leave affected areas looking black, brown or white in appearance. The affected area may also look leathery.

Instead of a red color, skin may appear black, yellow, brown, or white. There is little pain with third-degree burns because nerve endings have been damaged. Fourth-degree burns are the most severe and deepest burns, destroying every layer of skin and, sometimes, even muscles, tendons, or bone. As such, they are considered potentially life-threatening. Burns can also be classified as minor, moderate, or major depending on their overall size.

Damage to the bones, blood vessels and nerves can also occur, and a fatal heart attack may also result if the electrical current passes through the center of the body. The most common type of burn injury, a thermal burn injury, occurs as a result of residential fires, automobile accidents, matches, gasoline, heaters or electrical malfunctions.

Burns can vary in severity from mild to life-threatening. Most burns only affect the uppermost layers of skin, but depending on the depth of the burn, underlying tissues can also be affected. Traditionally, burns are characterized by degree, with first degree being least severe and third degree being most. However, a more precise classification system referring to the thickness or depth of the wound is now more commonly used. For the sake of this article, burns will be described by thickness. For a comparison of the two classification systems, see the table below. When the epidermis and dermis are both destroyed and the burn extends down into the subcutaneous tissue, including fat, muscles and even bones, this is referred to as a full-thickness burn (third- and fourth degree burn). For full-thickness burns, generally the skin will either be white, black, brown, charred, or leathery in appearance. Often eschar (dry, black necrotic tissue) will form around the wound. Since nerve endings are destroyed along with the dermis, these wounds are typically painless. However, most full-thickness wounds are surrounded by wounds of various thicknesses, so these areas may still be painful. Infection: One of the main functions of the skin is to act as a barrier against outside infection. However, this physical barrier is broken with partial or full thickness wounds.

A superficial second-degree burn involves heat injury to the upper third of the dermis. The microvessels perfusing this area are injured, and permeability is increased, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of plasma into the interstitium. This fluid lifts off the thin, heat-destroyed epidermis, causing blister formation. Despite loss of the entire basal layer of the epidermis, a burn of this depth will heal in 7 to 14 days. A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance. A zone of ischemia is present between the dead superficial tissue and the deeper living tissue. This marginally viable tissue can be readily converted to nonviable tissue by infection or a further decrease in blood flow.

Many victims of second-degree burns will have lived for a period between the injury and their death. The blistering of second-degree burns is rarely seen. These blisters are opened, drained, and treated long before the death. It is the systemic effects of kidney failure and generalized edema that must concern the embalmer. These bodies have a very high preservative demand. Circulation may be very difficult to establish. Very strong or waterless arterial solutions are needed to prepare these bodies. Dye is added to trace the distribution of solution. Multipoint injection, if the body has not been autopsied, is often needed. A major objective is creating dry clean skin for cosmetic work which includes: 1. Remove all loose skin before arterial injection using a good sharp razor (on visible areas). 2.

A superficial second-degree burn involves heat injury to the upper third of the dermis. The microvessels perfusing this area are injured, and permeability is increased, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of plasma into the interstitium. This fluid lifts off the thin, heat-destroyed epidermis, causing blister formation. Despite loss of the entire basal layer of the epidermis, a burn of this depth will heal in 7 to 14 days. A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance. A zone of ischemia is present between the dead superficial tissue and the deeper living tissue.

Third-degree burn victims would eventually, however, far surpass their less-seriously burned friends in lifetime scarring and disability. Because different areas of the skin conduct heat differently, location of the body areas exposed to heat may determine whether full-thickness burns result. The outermost layer of epidermis is an excellent insulator from heat; therefore, where it is thickest, as on the soles and palms, full-thickness burns are rare.

In deep partial-thickness burns, treatment with topical antimicrobial dressings is necessary to prevent infection as the burn wound heals. Contraction across joints, with resulting limitation in range of motion, is a common sequela. Splash scalds often cause second-degree burns.

Rarely, deeper tissues, such as muscle, bone, and blood vessels can also be injured. Burns may be treated with first aid, in an out-of-hospital setting, or may require more specialised treatment such as those available at specialised burn centers. Managing burn injuries properly is important because they are common, painful and can result in disfiguring and disabling scarring, amputation of affected parts or death in severe cases. Complications such as shock, infection, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, electrolyte imbalance and respiratory distress may occur. The treatment of burns may include the removal of dead tissue (debridement), applying dressings to the wound, fluid resuscitation, administering antibiotics and skin grafting. While large burns can be fatal, modern treatments developed in the last 60 years have significantly improved the prognosis of such burns, especially in children and young adults.[4][5] In the United States, approximately 4 out of every 100 people with injuries from burns will succumb to their injuries.

This can be difficult to estimate, particularly where different areas are burned to various degrees. **Superficial Burns:** The skin integrity is not disrupted. Capillaries and nerves are intact. Inflammation occurs normally with redness, pain, and warmth. This is the typical sunburn. **Partial-Thickness Burns:** The skin surface is damaged, but the injury is limited to outer layers. Capillaries are damaged, but deeper skin blood vessels and nerves are intact, allowing inflammation to produce blisters. There is fluid loss, redness, warmth, and pain. **Full-Thickness Burns:** The full thickness of skin is damaged. Capillaries, blood vessels, and nerves are destroyed. Normal inflammation cannot occur, thus blisters do not develop. The burned area may appear charred black or gray. The area may not be painful due to loss of nerves. Small full-thickness burns may appear to be less serious because of this. As with other injury, look first for potentially life-threatening problems.

In addition to skin contact burn injuries, smoke inhalation and internal injuries are other common results of fire-related incidents. In many cases, smoke inhalation can cause death. Other internal injuries can occur if someone inhales toxic chemicals or fumes, which can burn the lungs or throat. A majority of burns and burn injury cases result from exposure to flames and their extreme heat. This isn\u2019t the only way to receive a burn injury, however. A chemical burn might occur from the toxic exposure to a variety of dangerous compounds. These are different from other types of burn injuries because a heat source isn\u2019t necessary for danger to be present. Toxic substances that could cause chemical burns include sulfuric acid, lye, hydrochloric acid, and silver nitrate. An electrical burn injury could be caused by defective electrical products, defective wiring, or problem outlets. Approximately 1,000 people in the U.S. die each year from electrical burns.

Burns: A burn is an injury that may cause damage to the epidermis, dermis, hypodermis, or organs underneath. There are four degrees of burns based on the depth of tissue damage A first-degree burn, also called a superficial partial thickness burn, damages only the epidermis. An example of a first-degree burn is mild sunburn. A second-degree burn, also called a deep partial-thickness burn, is deeper and more severe than first-degree burns and involves both the epidermis and upper layers of the dermis. A third-degree burn, also called a full-thickness burn, destroying the epidermis, dermis, hair follicles, and associated glands and possibly extending into the subcutaneous tissue and underlying soft tissue. A fourth-degree burn is a full-thickness burn that extends down to the muscle or bone. Massage Therapy and Burns: Avoid massage over the burned area until it has completely healed.

Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. When the injury extends into some of the underlying layers, it is described as a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help relieve pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged exposure may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact.

Third-degree burn entails the complete destruction of all the layers of the skin and extends deep into the tissue below the skin. In these burns, the skin can appear black or white but will be very dry. However, there is often very little pain in these types of injuries due to the extensive damage to the nerves. These injuries normally require skin grafting and will often result in severe scarring. Fourth-degree burns are types of burns that are by far the most serious and will often result in severe impairment and disability. Fourth-degree burns involve burns to the deeper tissues such as the muscle, tendons, and bones. In these cases, you should seek prompt medical treatment.

The practice of classifying burns in \u2018degrees\u2019 was introduced in the 18th century. Two German surgeons, Heister (1724) and Richter (1788) classified burns into four degrees: First degree: Heat, pain and small blisters. Second degree: Severe pain and large blisters. Third degree: Damage to the skin and underlying flesh, with crust formation. Fourth degree: Damage to all soft tissues down to the bone. In 19th century, Guillaume Dupuytren developed a classification of burn depth after a review of the care of 50 patients. This classification divided burns into the following six degrees: First degree: Erythema. Second degree: Skin inflammation with epidermal detachment. Third degree: Partial destruction of the papillary layer and subpapillary network of the corium. Fourth degree: Destruction of the skin down to the subcuticular layer. Fifth degree: Crust formation over skin and muscle. Dupuytren\u2019s classification is still in use by some today.[39] However many modern writings tend to use a simpler three degree classification system and this may be attributed to a French surgeon, Boyer, and was introduced in the beginning of the 18th century (1814).[40] This classification divided burns into the following three degrees: Second degree: Blistering of the skin leading to superficial ulceration. Third degree: Tissue disorganization leading to a dry yellow crust. The current convention for describing burns is using depth rather than degrees; that is superficial, mixed depth and full thickness and new techniques are now in development to help physicians determine the depth of burns more accurately and objectively.

Third degree burns have a leathery, charred or white appearance. While burns can exceed these levels into the fourth degree, most of the public and medical community does not typically use this term. Fourth degree burns extend beyond the skin and cause damage to the underlying tendons and bones. Fifth and sixth burn degrees also exist but they are not considered survivable. Permanent Scarring Due to a Burn Injury If a burn injury victim is fortunate, the physical harm caused will not permanently damage their muscles, nerves, and other deep tissues. Irreversible scarring is likely to still occur, however, in any sort of accident that causes a burn injury. Given enough time, the scar tissue will no longer be sensitive to heat and touch but the victim is not fully recovered. They may experience a lowered self-esteem or diminished value of their own looks and identity. The result is physical scarring that leads to mental scarring as well. Any compensation earned through a lawsuit must keep these damages in mind, which are sometimes called nominal damages. Treatments for Burn Injury Victims When a burn injury can be improved through medical treatments and medicine, it is often a costly process that may take months to finalize.

While burns are a very common injury, there are other injuries that can be just as severe and have an equally detrimental impact on a persons\u2019 life. There are two types of burns from fires: flash burns and burns from flames. Flash burns result from a sudden intense heat, which usually result from some form of explosion. Generally, people who have sustained flash burns can be treated as an outpatient and do not require extensive medical care. On the other hand, those who suffer burns from flames may incur extensive damage depending on the severity of the burn. There are four widely accepted burn types, which are separated by degrees. First-degree burns affect only the top layer of skin, which is known as the epidermis. In these burn types the skin is usually red and painful, however, this burn is usually equivalent to a sunburn and the healing process normally does not take longer than 3-5 days. Second-degree burns can be classified as either partial or full thickness burns and are more severe than first degree burns. In a partial thickness burn, there can be a blister that involved the entire skin and upper layers of the skin known as the dermis.

Damage to the pulmonary system is a common and potentially dangerous condition that afflicts some burn victims. Inhalation injury is the most common cause of death in burn victims. Flash burns often harm the face but rarely involve the airway. The skin has several layers (see diagram). The deeper the burn injury is, the greater the number of layers that are damaged. Sweat glands and the roots of hair follicles are in the deeper layers and will be destroyed with a deep burn. Deep injuries heal more slowly, are more difficult to treat, and are more likely to have complications than superficial injuries. The names given to burn injuries of various depths have changed in recent decades.

Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. When the injury extends into some of the underlying layers, it is described as a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help relieve pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged exposure may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, because the subsequent inflammatory response causes significant capillary fluid leakage and edema.

They are most often the result of severe ultraviolet exposure or minor thermal injury. First-degree burns usually heal in five to 10 days 14). Deep second-degree burns involve the deeper layers of the dermis (i.e., reticular dermis). They appear white and do not blanch (Figures 6 and 7).

Skin may be charred or blackened and, because nerve damage is extensive, a victim who survives may feel no pain. Third- and fourth-degree burns or less-severe burns that cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks or a major joint are medical emergencies, the Mayo Clinic says. Less-severe burns require medical treatment if they have not healed after several weeks, or if the victim experiences an increase in pain, swelling or redness, or a discharge in the burned area. A severe burn injury causes disfigurement and requires a lengthy recovery, which may include multiple, painful skin graft surgeries.

Preference is given to fluid hydration, swelling and its complications, establishing and maintaining an airway, nutritional supplements, a catheter for monitoring urine output, X-rays and possible skin grafts. Burns damage the skin, which protects the body from fluid loss and infection, and can result in renal failure, life-threatening infections, shock and death. Fluid loss alters the balance of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium and water, requiring constant replacement and monitoring. Types of Burns Burns result from exposure to heat from fire or liquids, electricity, chemicals and radiation. Categories of burns are first-degree, second-degree and third-degree. First-degree burns damage the epidermis or outer layer of tissue and result in redness and pain. Second-degree burns damage epidermal and dermal tissue, the second layer of skin, and result in redness, pain and blisters. Third-degree burns damage skin down to the nerves, muscles, tendons and possibly bones, leaving a charred appearance with no pain as a result of nerve damage.

The distinctions between first and second degree burns are the same under both systems. If you have been diagnosed with a third degree burn, it is helpful to find out whether your medical provider uses the three or four degree classification. This distinction will help you determine the extent of the damage to the subcutaneous tissues that have been damaged along with the skin. In addition to the 3 or 4 degrees used to label the severity of the injury, burns may also be categorized based on how they occurred. Chemical burns, sometimes referred to as caustic burns, are caused by contact with an irritant such as an acid or base. The caustic substance is usually an industrial or household cleaner, but natural substances like spicy peppers can cause burns as well. Chemical burns can cause a reaction with the skin or internally, if swallowed or inhaled. Internal burns can cause permanent damage to the internal organs and require immediate treatment.

If a burn needs inpatient treatment, it should be done in a burn center. Very severe burns need treatment in a burn center. You may be most familiar with the traditional burn classification of first, second, and third-degree burns. First-degree burns are usually mild. They affect only the outer layer of skin (epidermis). The skin is likely to be red, and there may be some pain and swelling. Most sunburns are first-degree burns. Second-degree burns injure the second layer (dermis) of skin. The skin will be intensely red and may develop blisters. These burns are often very painful. Third-degree burns involve all the layers of skin. Fat, nerves, muscles, and even bone may be burned.

First-degree burns are mild and may heal quickly without any secondary complications. Second-degree burns. Second-degree burns damage both the outer and middle layers of skin, often causing blistering and infection. These types of burns are often treated in the emergency room, but, in some cases, they may require inpatient hospitalization. Third\u2013degree burns. Third-degree burns involve damage to the outer and inner layers of skin. These burns often cause serious secondary health complications for survivors and may necessitate amputation of severely burned finger, toes, or limbs. Treatment may involve skin grafts and prolonged hospitalization. In many cases, permanent disfigurement results. Fourth-degree burns. This is the most serious type of burn and involves damage to the muscle, tendons, and bones. Depending on the circumstances, fourth-degree burns can result in loss of limb, extensive disfigurement, disability, and/or wrongful death. The severity of a burn injury has a direct impact on the financial and psychological costs to victims and their families. Second, third, and fourth-degree burns are more likely to cause disfigurement, amputations and other complications. These may severely reduce the quality of life and require extensive medical care.

This is the body\u2019s attempt to heal the injury and protect the lower layers of skins. Care for these burns does not always require professional medical care. However, if the burn is large enough, a trip to the hospital may be necessary. Third-degree burns are severe medical emergencies and require intensive treatment to heal. Third-degree burns cause damage to every layer of the skin and damage nerve ending and tissues underneath the skin. This serious injury makes the skin stiff and hard with dark or white coloration. Fourth-degree burns are similar to third-degree burns, but they represent an even more dangerous level of injury. With this type of burn, the damage may extend past the skin and into the muscles and bone. This burn may cause so much damage that healing is not a possibility. Fourth-degree burns often require amputation. Even if a victim fully recovers, the damaged skin usually does not heal back to its original appearance. Burn scars are notorious for causing physical and emotional trauma. Physically, burn scars can produce tighter skin and limit physical movement.

This causes the muscles in the leg to contract and pull the toe away from the source of injury (6). At the same time, the dorsal horn sends another impulse up the spinal cord to the brain. During this trip, the impulse travels between nerve cells. When the impulse reaches a nerve ending (7), the nerve releases chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which carry the message to the adjacent nerve. When the impulse reaches the brain (8), it is analyzed and processed as an unpleasant physical and emotional sensation. Types of burns The Ayat under discussion mentions the burning of the skin. The severity of a burn depends on its depth, its extent, and the age of the victim. Burns are classified by depth as first, second, and third degree. First-degree burns cause redness and pain (e.g., sunburn). Second-degree burns are marked by blisters (e.g., scald by hot liquid). In third-degree burns, both the epidermis and dermis (external and internal parts of the skin) are destroyed, and underlying tissue may also be damaged.

These occur when extended exposure to a very hot object burns through all three layers of your skin, sometimes causing muscle, fat, and bone damage. They will look leathery and have a white or black appearance on the skin. Third degree burns are major burns and require treatment from a doctor as soon as possible. Burns can be caused by fires, electrical shock, exposure to chemicals, or from scalding liquids. The American Burn Association compiled data from admissions to burn centers between 2005 to 2014.

Seventy-three percent of the fire incidents happened at home, followed by work with eight percent and the street or highway (car fires) at five percent. Serious burn injuries are sometimes manageable through wound care, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and surgical procedures. If an adult suffers a burn injury that covers more than 15% of his/her body, doctors will most likely treat the victim with intravenous fluids.

Second-degree burns are more serious and extend into the outer epidermis layer and the lower layer of skin (the dermis). You might receive a second-degree burn from accidentally pouring boiling water onto your body or touching a hot clothes iron. In addition to pain and redness, most second-degree burns cause blistering and swelling. Third-degree burns are among the most severe burns. They burn all the way through the epidermis and dermis skin layers and damage the tissue underneath. Skin may turn white or blackened and charred and it may go numb if nerves were damaged. Most severe burn injuries that result in lawsuits, such as those from fires or electrical shocks, are third-degree burns. Some medical professionals also use additional categories \u2013 up to the sixth degree \u2013 to indicate injuries that burn down into ligaments, tendons, muscles, bones, or internal organs. Third-degree burns and worse, especially if they cover a significant percentage of the body, can lead to a range of complications and may require extended hospitalization and skin-graft surgeries. If the burn damages muscle and other interior tissue, patients may require physical therapy to regain range of motion. Because of extensive nerve damage, burns at these levels can cause chronic pain.

Since both the epidermis and dermis are injured in a second-degree burn, it is known as a deep partialthickness or partial-thickness burn. Third-degree burns damage all layers of the skin and in severe cases can injure underlying structures such as muscle and bone. Burns of this type leave charred, blackened, and/or dry, pearly white areas (photos 77 and ). The patient may suffer severe pain. However, this pain is probably the result of nearby second-degree burns, as the nerve endings are often destroyed in third-degree burns. Third-degree burns heal poorly since the regenerative powers of the tissues have been lost. If left to its own resources, the burn usually will scar over from the edges where viable tissue still exists. Skin grafting is required to bring about proper healing of the burn. Thirddegree burns are also defined as full-thickness burns, as they extend throughout all dermal layers and possibly to the subcutaneous layers, muscle, and bone. Photos 77 and 78: Third-degree burns to the foot and arm. Note the blackened and pearly white areas. Some emergency health care providers have moved away from the use of first through third degree as measures of burn depth, replacing these measures with categorizations of either superficial or deep burn. Should the PHCP hear of a burn referred to as superficial, he can expect to find a burn that is reddened, swollen, and tender. A deep burn is one that is surrounded"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "The skin is the primary protection of humans from the surroundings. And so, it is the first to be affected by the numerous stimuli and other irritants that the body encounters every second of the day. Unfortunately, it is almost always exposed to potential dangers. The most common form of injury that the skin can contract is the burn. The burn is any damage to your tissues, more commonly the skin, that can be caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, or even radiation. When the skin is subjected to this, the first thing to do is to stay calm and do the proper first aid before calling professional attention, if necessary. Step 1: Assess the affected area for the extent of the burn. Burns are classified into three degrees, and your first aid solutions will be based on the degree of the burn. The first degree burn is the mildest form that affects only the topmost layer of the skin. The skin would be dry, reddish, a bit painful, and with only minor swelling. On the other hand, the second degree burn involves the skin tissues beneath the topmost layer. The skin would have blisters, appears redder, and and sometimes would even break open. This is quite painful. The most serious of all is the third degree burn, which involves all the layers of the skin, the muscles beneath it, and sometimes, even the bones. The injured may feel little pain or even numb in the area because of severe nerve damage. The skin will be dry"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "and ulcer formation. The practice of classifying burns in \u2018degrees\u2019 was introduced in the 18th century. Two German surgeons, Heister (1724) and Richter (1788) classified burns into four degrees: First degree: Heat, pain and small blisters. Second degree: Severe pain and large blisters. Third degree: Damage to the skin and underlying flesh, with crust formation. Fourth degree: Damage to all soft tissues down to the bone. In 19th century, Guillaume Dupuytren developed a classification of burn depth after a review of the care of 50 patients. This classification divided burns into the following six degrees: First degree: Erythema. Second degree: Skin inflammation with epidermal detachment. Third degree: Partial destruction of the papillary layer and subpapillary network of the corium. Fourth degree: Destruction of the skin down to the subcuticular layer. Fifth degree: Crust formation over skin and muscle. Dupuytren\u2019s classification is still in use by some today.[39] However many modern writings tend to use a simpler three degree classification system and this may be attributed to a French surgeon, Boyer, and was introduced in the beginning of the 18th century (1814).[40] This classification divided burns into the following three degrees: Second degree: Blistering of the skin leading to superficial ulceration. Third degree: Tissue disorganization leading to a dry yellow crust. The current convention for describing burns is using depth rather than degrees; that is superficial, mixed depth and full thickness and new techniques are now in development to help physicians determine the depth of burns more accurately and objectively. These include thermal imaging[41], the use of"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "destroyed. A superficial second-degree burn involves heat injury to the upper third of the dermis. The microvessels perfusing this area are injured, and permeability is increased, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of plasma into the interstitium. This fluid lifts off the thin, heat-destroyed epidermis, causing blister formation. Despite loss of the entire basal layer of the epidermis, a burn of this depth will heal in 7 to 14 days. A deep dermal(or deep second-degree) burn extends well into the dermal layer, and fewer viable epidermal cells remain. Therefore, reepithelialization is extremely slow, sometimes requiring months. The wound surface usually is red, with white areas in deeper parts. Because the remaining blood supply is marginal, there is a high probability that the tissue damage will deepen with time. A full-thickness (or third-degree) burn occurs with destruction of the entire epidermis and dermis, leaving no residual epidermal cells to repopulate the burned area. The portion of the wound not closed by wound contraction will require skin grafting. The exact depth of many deep burns cannot be defined on first appearance. A zone of ischemia is present between the dead superficial tissue and the deeper living tissue. This marginally viable tissue can be readily converted to nonviable tissue by infection or a further decrease in blood flow. Severity of Injury The size of the burn is defined as a percentage of the TBS. A useful initial guide is the rule of nines, which divides the body into areas that each represent 9% of the TBS.

The burn codes are for thermal burns, except sunburns, that come from a heat source, such as a fire or hot appliance. The burn codes are also for burns resulting from electricity and radiation. Corrosions are burns due to chemicals. The guidelines are the same for burns and corrosions. Current burns (T20-T25) are classified by depth, extent and by agent (X code). Burns are classified by depth as first degree (erythema), second degree (blistering), and third degree (full-thickness involvement). Burns of the eye and internal organs (T26-T28) are classified by site, but not by degree. Sequencing of burn and related condition codes Sequence first the code that reflects the highest degree of burn when more than one burn is present. When the reason for the admission or encounter is for treatment of external multiple burns, sequence first the code that reflects the burn of the highest degree. When a patient has both internal and external burns, the circumstances of admission govern the selection of the principal diagnosis or first-listed diagnosis.

Third degree burns are visually indicated by eschar formation and charring. This type of classification, which has been used with only minor alterations for nearly two hundred years, is concerned chiefly with the intensity of burning and not with the depth of tissue destroyed. Only recently have burn physicians come to realize that the depth of injury is of greater importance than superficial appearance. The classification of burns that has recently been adopted has completely forsaken all reference to outward appearances, which are only an indication of the severity of surface burning. The new type of classification recognizes two degrees of burn injury. The first new classification is partial thickness skin loss, implying the presence of sufficient living epithelial elements to resurface the area. The second new classification is full-thickness skin loss, implying virtually complete destruction of all epithelial elements so that healing can only occur by contraction of the wound and epithelial cell migration from the edge of the wound or by surgical intervention. Proper treatment depends on the correct classification of the burn. Further, early differentiation between these two degrees of burns is critical for several reasons. It is better to excise dead tissue and close the wound than to allow spontaneous separation of the slough, with its attendant risks of infection, fibrosis, and loss of function.

The bathroom exploded, probably due to a buildup of methane. His parents were awakened by the noise to discover both boys screaming in the back yard. Maurice, the boys\u2019 father, quickly dressed while the boys\u2019 mother put Jason in a cold shower. Maurice then drove both children to the hospital. As it turned out, Ryan was much less severely burned and was able to be treated at a local hospital. Jason, on the other hand, sustained third-degree burns to 85 percent of his body, a devastating injury that only a decade or so before would have likely been lethal.

Superficial burns (First Degree) involve only the epidermis and are warm, painful, red, soft and blanch when touched. Usually, there is no blistering. A typical example is a sunburn. Partial thickness burns (Second Degree) extend through the epidermis and into the dermis. The depth into the dermis can vary (superficial or deep dermis). These burns are typically very painful, red, blistered, moist, soft and blanch when touched. Examples include burns from hot surfaces, hot liquids or flame.

The lesion appears blackened, is minimally painful, and frequently requires surgical intervention. Q. How are scald injuries classified in children, on the basis of body surface area and depth? The severity of scalds is assessed on the basis of depth (or layers of skin involved) and size, or the percentage of TBSA affected. Wilson's classification as first-, second-, and third-degree or superficial, partial thickness or full-thickness burns is similar in children and adults. However, in newborns and children, the commonly used \u201cRule of nine\u201d to determine the extent of TBSA affected is not applicable due to different body proportions (i.e. larger heads and smaller limbs).

The purpose of this study was to determine, with serial biopsies, the progressive skin changes in thermal burns from the time of burning to the end of the pathological and healing process. The available literature primarily is concerned with the terminal effects of burns without particular study of the timing and characteristics of the early histopathological changes.

According to the general classifications, first degree burns involve the epidermis, dissecting mostly the outer layers with vesication, hyperemia and sight edema of the dermis.

In 1952, J.B.Perkins, H.E.Pease and H.D.Kingsley of the University of Rochester, investigated the relation of intensity of applied thermal energy to the severity of flash fire burns[6]. Comparing results of this study with those of Alice Stoll shows that a larger amount of energy is required to induce second degree burn. Results of this study are represented in Figure 1 line (B). Figure 1 line (C) shows second degree burn threshold as reported by Wordie H. Parr[7]. The results were obtained by exposing skin to laser radiation and determining dose-response relationship for producing different grades of burns. The Figure 1 shows that the Wordie H. Parr curve lies between those proposed by Alice Stoll and those proposed by the University of Rochester study. The explanation for these second degree burn threshold differences could be interpreted by the fact that thermal injury depends on energy absorbed per unit volume or mass to produce a critical temperature elevation. Skin reflectance and penetration greatly influence this absorption. Also, heat conduction in tissue is far more efficient for smaller than for larger irradiated areas and exposure to higher levels of irradiance would be possible before injury occurred. Indeed, with extensive irradiation, injury would occur at far lower level of irradiance[8].

Generally, the burn is classified according to the depth: Superficial (first-degree) only involves skin epidermis; Superficial partial-thickness (superficial second-degree) involves superficial dermis; Deep partial-thickness (deep second-degree) involves the deeper dermis; Full-thickness (third-degree) includes the whole layer of epidermis and dermis, reaching the subcutaneous tissue, and even muscles and bones are damaged. 9"}, {"title": "pes2o", "text": "non-blistered skin, second-degree burns: blisters and some thickening of the skin, third-degree burns: widespread thickness with a white, leathery appearance.

At the cellular level, we see an increase of vascular permeability and an increased risk of microthrombus. At the macro level, we see three concentric circles developing around the wound after cutaneous burns, ranging from interior to exterior and termed the zone of necrosis, the zone of stasis and the zone of hyperemia . The microcirculation in the zone of stasis is characterized by the formation of progressive microthrombus. The location of the zone of stasis varies according to the depth of the burns. Burns affecting dermis are termed second-degree burns while third-degree burns involve the full-thickness of skin as well as subcutaneous tissues. The ultimate burn depth is determined by the development of the stasis zone, which may extend full-thickness, arresting blood circulation and causing tissue necrosis resulting in third-degree burn. However, if there is some improvement in the microcirculation in the zone of stasis, deep second-degree burns will rarely deteriorate into third-degree burns. BRT was designed to deal with the zone of stasis by improving the microcirculation, avoiding the formation of microthrombus and thereby arresting progressive necrosis. Recent research suggests that significant release of vascular active factors in plasma, endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO), has a close correlation with the deterioration of vulnerable tissue within the zone of stasis during the early postburn stage[2-4].

For the elderly, it can be the same, but also a risky undertaking. In all age groups, tap water scalds are the second most common cause of burn injuries. Elderly loved ones, however, are at a greater risk for scalding than other populations for a variety of reasons. The Burn Foundation says that hot water causes third-degree burns in one second at 156 degrees F, in two seconds at 149 degrees F, in five seconds at 140 degrees F, and in 15 seconds at 133 degrees F. Scalding is a second-degree burn that is deep and results in splitting of skin layers and/or blistering. The solution would seem to be to simply decrease the water temperature; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) manual on Legionnaire\u2019s disease (a potentially fatal infectious disease) says differently, however. Water is to be stored at a minimum of 140 degrees F, but can be delivered at a minimum of 122 degrees F to ensure harmful bacteria are killed. A caregiver must first recognize the level of risk their loved one has for scalding, and also know ways to prevent unnecessary burns, while maintaining a safe water temperature.

Introduction Burns, irrespective of their severity level, are one of the most common causes of accidental injuries worldwide [1][2][3][4]. In first-degree burns, only the superficial layers of the epidermis are affected, allowing tissue repair via the mobilization of the keratinocyte stem cells and progenitors residing in the basal layer [5]. As a result, first-degree burns heal spontaneously without scar formation and do not require any treatment other than a topical moisturizer [6]. In contrast, third-degree burns do not heal spontaneously and require surgical intervention to cover wounds (autografts, allografts, epidermal sheets) [5,7]. Although current treatments have greatly increased the survival rate of patients suffering from extended third-degree burns [8], it is estimated that burns cause 180,000 deaths per year according to a recent report of the World Health Organization. In addition to being potentially fatal, severe skin burns may result in long-term functional and/or aesthetic complications [9], notably when the healing process is hampered by secondary infections and abnormal tissue remodeling. [3]. Finally, superficial partial-thickness (superficial second-degree) burns spontaneously heal within a time period of 7 to 14 days post-burn, as there are still mitotically active stem cells in the basal layer. On the other hand, deep second-degree burns destroy the entire epidermis, including the cells of the basal layer, and result in the formation of a scar. Delayed complications may occur during the healing process of deep second-degree burns requiring then the use of surgical treatments [6,7].

To classify burn depths is an under-researched area in Pakistan and has got the great attention of researchers and practitioners.

The objective of this paper is to identify the depth of burnt human skin and to analyze the burns by classifying among first, second and third-degree burns. In this regard, we used the Otsu method of thresholding for segmentation and then applied the statistical method to obtain the feature vector. The maximum average accuracy obtained by using multiple classifiers is reported round about 74.86%.

In patients with a greater percent burn area, hospitalization may be prolonged and complications may develop. Furthermore, increased use of workforce and medical materials lead to increased cost of care (Ahn and Maitz 2012). We found a significant difference between burn degrees with regard to the cost of care. Burn degree and depth are similarly known to affect patient prognosis. In our study, the cost of care of second-degree burns was greater than third degree burns. Follow-up appointments of second-degree burn injuries are recommended to be spaced more closely to avoid complications. This probably led to a higher cost by increasing the number of procedures performed and medical equipment used at each visit, increasing overall cost in our study. We failed to detect any significant difference between the cost of care of patients managed surgically versus non-surgically (p = 0.206). Jansen et al.

In the present study, 38 (>97%) of 39 cases with undetectable haemolysis had > 20% TBSA. TBSA was strongly associated with undetectable haptoglobin, even after adjustment for confounding factors. Physiopathology of renal toxicity of haemolysis is probably multifactorial, including (1) the role of the fHb azote monoxide (NO) scavenger, decreasing its bioavailability and therefore inducing systemic vasoconstriction; and (2) direct toxicity of fHb aggregating into casts in the tubular lumen [14,15].

On behalf of Miller, Montiel & Strano, P.C. on Thursday, March 28, 2019. When you want to use hot water in your home, the goal is to make it hot enough to kill bacteria and to feel hot to the touch, but you don't want it so hot that it burns you. When the temperature gauges are not working correctly, it's possible that the water could become so hot that it causes burns. There are two types of safety controls on a boiler. The first is the safety relief valve, which protects people from high temperatures and high pressures. The next is the low-water cutoff, which turns off the boiler if there isn't enough water. If a landlord neglects to maintain or fix faulty boiler controls, tenants can get seriously injured. Why is it important to prevent high-temperature water from contacting the skin? Anything hot can cause damage to the skin, including water. Did you know that you could suffer a third-degree burn by exposing your skin to 150-degree water for only two seconds? If the water is as hot as 140 degrees, you'll suffer third-degree burns after just five-to-six seconds of exposure. The risk of burns continues on a downward trend as temperatures decline. Typically, it is safe to bathe in water of 120 degrees or less, which is the typical maximum recommended setting for boilers.

Burn injury victims can potentially face physical, emotional, and mental changes in their everyday lives. No one ever expects to have to go through something like this, which is why it is important to seek legal help from a burn injury attorney. Burns can be categorized into three different types, which are first, second, and third-degree burns, and they are determined by severity. First Degree \u2013 The first layer of skin gets damaged, but is not completely destroyed. The color of the skin may turn bright pink or red. You should not expect to blister from a first degree burn. The skin may peel off over the course of a few days. These types of burns are the easiest to treat and typically heal within one to two weeks. Second Degree \u2013This type of burn can be moderate to severe, as the first and second layer of skin (the epidermis and dermis) become damaged. Second degree burns often result in blistering. Depending on the severity, a skin graft may be needed. This type of burn can heal anywhere from two to eight weeks. Third-Degree \u2013These types of burns are the most severe and dangerous, as it extends to the deepest layer of skin. All three layers of the skin become destroyed and can blister.

This type of burn heals in the space of 7-10 days, without leaving any scar. In this type of burn, the damage done doesn\u2019t just happen at the skin\u2019s surface, it goes beyond the surface, the top layer. And, that\u2019s why it\u2019s more serious than that of the First-Degree. The Second-Degree burn makes the skin to blister and ends up being sore and red. A few of these blisters pop open, making the burn to have an appearance that\u2019s wet. There\u2019s a tissue known as fibrinous exudate \u2014 as time goes on, this particular tissue will, probably, begin to take its place around, over the wound.

And also, bandage it in a proper manner \u2014 doing these helps you to stay away from infection. This also does well in helping the burn heal fastly.

Third-Degree Burns: The most severe type of burns, third-degree burns affect the upper and lower layers of skin, as well as the muscles, tissues, and sometimes bones beneath the skin. These burns often result in whitened or blackened skin and very high levels of pain. Regardless of the type, all burns can result in other related injuries.

This system was devised by the French barber-surgeon Ambroise Pare and remains in use today.[7] It is often difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn.

As such, a second-degree partial-thickness burn can progress to a third-degree burn over time even after initial treatment. Distinguishing between the superficial-thickness burn and the partial-thickness burn is important, as the former may heal spontaneously, whereas the latter often requires surgical excision and skin grafting.

Superficial second-degree burns usually result in clear blisters appearing, extreme pain, and the surface of the skin being much more moist, while deep thickness burns result in heavy scarring and drier skin around the site of the burn. Both of these burns take weeks to heal and require proper bandaging and treatment. Third-degree burns: occurs when damage extends through the entire dermis and affects organs and nerves. Common signs of a third-degree burn include dry skin, white or black wounds, and nerve or tissue damage. Treatment for a third-degree burn often requires skin grafts and extensive surgery, and even then may not fully restore the skin to its original, pre-accident condition. Fourth-degree burns: the most serious type of burn, fourth-degree burns are when damage goes all the way through the skin and down to the underlying muscle and bone.

The Mayo Clinic explains that there are three degrees of burn severity. Here is a look at each: First degree: This type of burn only affects the epidermis, which is the outer layer of skin. Symptoms of first degree burns include redness and pain, and treatment of first degree burns can usually be done at home. Second degree: Second degree burns involve the two outermost layers of skin, the epidermis and the dermis. This type of burn can cause redness, swelling, or blotchy skin. Blisters may develop, pain may be severe, and second degree burns can lead to scarring. Third degree: Third degree burns are those that reach into the fat layer beneath the skin. Burned areas may look black, brown, or white and the skin may look leathery. Third degree burns may cause significant scarring as well as damage to the nerves that can lead to numbness. Burns of particular concern include those that are deep or cover a wide area of the body. The reason for concern is the increased risk of complications, including: Bacterial infection, which may travel to the bloodstream and cause sepsis. Fluid loss, including low blood volume.

As the sun\u2019s rays travel through space, they move very rapidly, as if in a vacuum, but when contact is made with the more dense atmospheric medium of the earth, the light decelerates, and is bend around the curvature of the earth by the law of refraction. This law causes the light to reach the surface before the sun appears in the morning, and to trail behind on the surface long after the early evening sun disappears.

It\u2019s easy for a bulb or a star to cast shadows outwards; simply place a solid object at some distance from the light. A piece of paper or your hand will suffice for a light bulb; something on the opposite side of your hand will be deprived of the light from the bulb.

For some purposes, scattering and reflection at the surface can also be neglected for LW radiation. Additional notes and observations of scattering of solar radiation: When there is a hole through which direct solar rays pass, scattering along the path of the beam allows the beam to glow with scattered radiation - it can be seen from outside itself. This can be observed in a dusty room with sunlight coming through a window. A shadow cast through the air can also be seen from outside itself by the same mechanism. Variations in direct solar ray intensity can be seen to the extent that they have optical thickness along the line of sight and there is not too much optical thickness along the line of sight between the viewer and variation being observed. These variations are called crepescular rays and can be seen when the direct sun is blocked by a layer of clouds with holes, or there are patches of clouds casting shadows, or when the sun is behind a cloud with an irregular edge. One particularly interesting case is the shadow cast be a long thin straight contrail (the cloud left by a jet when conditions allow).

The end of the eaves on Trent's garage were approximately twenty inches from the wall (I measured this on a building of similar construction), yet the shadows are still sharp and distinct.

It looks to be like a security or courtesy light coming on, probably an IR sensor triggered by the object. As an aside, this is contrary to the text accompanying the video which says there is no other lighting, but likely just an oversight. I think that light, the image becoming lighter once the glare has gone, combined with the CCTV over-emphasising the amount of illumination is probably making it look like the object is illuminating the area more than it actually is.

Credit: NASA, ESA, STScI, WP Maksym (CfA) This Hubble Space Telescope image of the heart of the active galaxy IC 5063, 156 million light-years from Earth, reveals a mixture of bright rays and dark shadows coming from its blazing core, the home of a supermassive black hole. Astronomers suggest that a ring of dusty material surrounding the black hole may be casting its shadow into space. According to their scenario, this interplay of light and shadow may occur when light blasted by the monster black hole strikes the dust ring, which is buried deep inside the core. Light streams through gaps in the ring, creating the brilliant cone-shaped rays. However, denser patches in the disc block some of the light, casting long, dark shadows through the galaxy. This phenomenon is similar to sunlight piercing Earthly clouds at sunset \u2013 such as in the image below from Grand Tetons National Park in the US \u2013 creating a mixture of bright rays and dark shadows formed by beams of light scattered by the atmosphere. The darker regions represent the clouds casting shadows where sunlight could not pass through. The big difference, of course, is that the bright rays and dark shadows appearing in IC 5063 are happening on a much larger scale \u2013 shooting across at least 36,000 light-years.

On the sunny afternoon I spent at the sculpture park a few weeks ago, a long, segmented sliver of light and shadow cast itself along the bottom of Haven\u2019s wall drawing. Its regular rhythm corresponded to the repeated cadence of glass and steel from the west wall of Weiss/Manfredi\u2019s pavilion architecture. The building was throwing both light and its own shadow onto the wall. When I stepped outside, I snapped a few pictures looking back through the pavilion\u2019s glass walls. Later, indoors, when I could look at the images away from the dazzling afternoon light, I saw reflections from the outdoor chairs, the surrounding buildings, and the sky. They all cast their colors and shapes, but mutedly, more hazily, onto the transparent glass and, through it, onto Blue Sun inside. I had seen these things as I walked around that afternoon, but I hadn\u2019t noticed them doubled in the glass. My camera had made its own memory.

Observation of the shadow of black hole candidate Sagittarius A$^*$ or Sgr A$^*$ is one of the most important goals of the Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique. It should able to image the black hole with resolution at the level of the event horizon. At galactic center the black hole candidate Sgr A$^*$, due to the gravitational lensing effect casts a shadow; the shape and size of this shadow can be calculated. There is a widespread belief that evidence for the existence of black holes will come from the direct observation of its shadow. The shape of a shadow could be used to study extreme gravity near the event horizon and also to know whether the general relativity is consistent with the observations. Observation of a black hole shadow may allow us to determine the mass and spin of a rotating black hole \\cite{Vries, Takahashi04, Takahashi041,Bambi:2008jg,Bambi:2010hf,Goddi:2016jrs}. As black holes are basically non emitting objects, it is of interest the study null geodesics around them where photons coming from other sources move to lead to a shadow.

The atoms in gases are pretty far apart. Light slows down only a very tiny bit in air; it's almost not even worth mentioning. But in glass, light slows down substantially, from 300,000 km/s to something under 200,000 km/s. The exact amount depends on the type of glass. So when light enters a piece of glass (from air), it slows down suddenly. It's just like running down the beach, then hitting the water and slowing down as you have to struggle to move your legs through the water. Okay, so what's this got to do with the light bending? Imagine you're running down the beach with a group of friends, holding hands or with your arms linked together. You run side by side and at the same speed, so you form a nice straight line sweeping across the sand, straight towards the water. Now everyone in the line hits the water at the same time, and everyone suddenly has to slow down. That's fine, everyone slows down at the same time, so your entire line of friends, considered as a single object, just slows down, and everyone stays in line. This is just like what happens when light hits a piece of glass straight on. It just slows down. Figure 3. Line of people bending as they enter water.

It's with some trepidation that I'm starting this section of my blog, because I really don't understand physics very well. Most of it, I suspect, will be about how little I understand. But I'm going to give it a whirl. Sometime this summer it occurred to me that the phenomenon of transparency is more more complex than one might initially think, and more so than most people realize. I went around asking people with more physics education than I had if they could explain to me why things like glass and water are transparent, and it seemed to me that not only did they not understand it any better than I did, but they didn't realize that they didn't understand it. A common response, for example, was that media like glass and water are transparent because the light passes through them unimpeded. This is clearly wrong. We can see that it's wrong because both glass and water have a tendency to refract incident light. Unimpeded photons always travel in straight lines. If light is refracted by a medium, it is because the photons couple with electrons in the medium, are absorbed, and then new photons are emitted"}, {"title": "rpj_common_crawl_2020_05", "text": "tank is a good way to see this sort of thing.

But how can a piece of glass do this? The process is actually very simple. As light travels from one medium to another, it changes speed. Light travels more quickly through air than it does through glass, so a lens slows it down. When light waves enter a piece of glass at an angle, one part of the wave will reach the glass before another and so will start slowing down first. This is something like pushing a shopping cart from pavement to grass, at an angle. The right wheel hits the grass first and so slows down while the left wheel is still on the pavement. Because the left wheel is briefly moving more quickly than the right wheel, the shopping cart turns to the right as it moves onto the grass. The effect on light is the same -- as it enters the glass at an angle, it bends in one direction. It bends again when it exits the glass because parts of the light wave enter the air and speed up before other parts of the wave. In a standard converging, or convex lens, one or both sides of the glass curves out. This means rays of light passing through will bend toward the center of the lens on entry. In a double convex lens, such as a magnifying glass, the light will bend when it exits as well as when it enters."}, {"title": "rpj_stackexchange", "text": "a slanted angle?

This would imply that the change in angle at different points etc etc would have to happen in a very special way to give this pattern. A: What is happening, in my opinion, is the result of two effects: First one is to notice that the glass of your window is most probably not uniform. Meaning, as a guess, it is thinner on the top and gradually gets thicker to the bottom, but in a very slight manner that only light feels it. What does this cause? Well if the glass also has two different refraction indices, say $n_v$ for vertical refraction index and $n_h$ for horizontal refraction index, then the polarization of the light traveling through the glass will rotate due to this non-isometry $n_h \\neq n_v$.

It can travel only about two-thirds as fast through a piece of glass as it can through empty space or air, and about three-quarters as fast through water as through air. This slowing down is important, as it makes it possible for us to bend beams of light, and thus to make prisms, lenses, eye-glasses, telescopes, microscopes, cameras and other devices that help us to see better. When a light ray moves from one substance to another so that its speed is changed, the ray changes direction. This is called refraction. There are some objects which do not reflect light, but permit it to pass through, while slowing it down somewhat, according to the density of the object. Water, which is denser than air, will slow the light velocity by about one-fourth, while glass which is more dense, will slow its speed of travel by one-third. One can observe the changed effect in water, by dangling an object partially below and partially above the water\u2019s surface. Light directed head-on at a medium such as glass will not deflect or bend the ray of light. It will pass straight through.

OK, the second way is to make the light pass straight _through_ the object.

This is partly what makes the glass look so good. By applying a filter, we can tint and darken the glass without adding any computational overhead. The effect of a filter color is as if the glass is coated in a thin layer of transparent material. When you want to simulate colored glass, you need to use absorption factors. Truly colored glass absorbs more light in thicker areas since the light has to travel further through the glass. The shape's thickness varies and the glass is still very transparent near the thin parts, whereas it becomes increasingly dark in the thick areas. Dispersion is another property that all refractive materials share in the real world but which is rarely included in renderings. Typically we assign transparent materials an Index-Of-Refraction (IOR) value. IOR controls how sharply the light is bend when it enters the material. In reality, the IOR differs per photon wavelenght. Red light contains less energy than blue light and tends to bend less when refracted (it has a lower IOR for any given material than blue light).

Concepts like band gap energy and the connection between energy and wavelength are needed to form plausible, detailed hypotheses which address the readily observed aspects of these phenomena. The transparancy of glass is a quantum phenomenon. It is owed to the fact that the electrons in the silicon crystals require an inordinate amount of energy in order to get exited into a higher orbital. This means that low energy photons like visible light can pass through unhindered. Meanwhile, UV light has enough energy to be absorbed. Glass is transparent, but you don't get a sunburn.

A: Possibly some semantic confusion here. Glass, with a simple refractive index, does not \"absorb\" light, it is transparent. Therefore the amount of light that emerges on the other side, for a given angle of incidence, is independent of the thickness of the glass. Instead, some of the incident light is reflected from the first boundary as the light enters the glass, and some is reflected from the second boundary as it exits the glass. Perhaps this is what you are calculating? Have a look at Fresnel Equations. Of course, real materials do absorb/scatter light, but you need a complex refractive index to sort that out. Do you have a complex refractive index? If you do then the light is exponentially attenuated as it travels through the material, but the amount of intensity attenuation depends on the (vacuum) wavelength of the light, $\\lambda$, and the path length through the glass, roughly as $\\exp(-4\\pi \\kappa x/\\lambda)$, where $\\kappa$ is the imaginary part of the refractive index and $x$ is the path length (which will be $t$ for normal incidence, but larger for non-normal incidence).

A: They technically should \"bend\" because of refraction, and a more accurate drawing would be this: But drawings like the one that you show usually just tell you the net effect of the lens, i.e. treating the lens as a black box and not a series of interfaces. In the derivation of the thin lens equation, however, both curved surfaces, refractive indices, and radii of curvature are taken into account. A: You are right. The drawing shown in your question is quite poor. Here is a much better drawing, which correctly shows the refraction of rays on both convex surfaces.

The path length of light in opaque media November 10, 2017 Light on its way through a liquid: In case of a transparent liquid (left) light paths are straight lines. In case the liquid is made opaque through nanoparticles (right) light paths get more complicated through scattering. Some of the paths become longer, others shorter - on average though the length of light paths is the same as in the transparent case. Credit: Vienna University of Technology A seemingly paradoxical prediction in physics has now been confirmed in an experiment: No matter whether an object is opaque or transparent, the average length of the light's paths through the object is always the same.

Together the work of these two men is known as the Ewald-Oseen Extinction Theorem. What's so mysterious about how a window works. Isn't a window merely a sheet of glass? When light strikes a window some of it bounces off (about 10%) and the remainder is refracted (bent) into the glass at an angle that depends on a number \"n\" called the refractive index which is different for different materials. If n is greater than 1, the light bends deeper into the material; if n is less than 1, the light bends towards the surface. In a vacuum the speed of light is equal to a constant c. But in material media, the velocity v of light is equal to: v = c/n. For visible light in glass, the refractive index is about 1.5, so light travels at about 70% of its vacuum speed: inside glass, light travels SLOW.

Some materials are opaque to some frequencies of light, but transparent to others. Glass is opaque to ultraviolet light, but transparent to visible light. The atoms in some materials hold on to their electrons loosely. In other words, the materials contain many free electrons that can jump readily from one atom to another within the material. When the electrons in this type of material absorb energy from an incoming light wave, they do not pass that energy on to other atoms. The energized electrons merely vibrate and then send the energy back out of the object as a light wave with the same frequency as the incoming wave. The overall effect is that the light wave does not penetrate deeply into the material. In most metals, electrons are held loosely, and are free to move around, so these metals reflect visible light and appear to be shiny. The electrons in glass have some freedom, though not as much as in metals. To a lesser degree, glass reflects light and appears to be shiny, as well.

This means there will be no phase shift at that reflection, since air has a lower index of refraction than either film. Before the separation, the second reflection within the plastic was off a faster medium (glass), so there is no change to the phase shift for the plastic, and the same interference as before (destructive) will result.

At the interface, it is bent in one direction if the material it enters is denser (when light slows down) and in the OTHER direction if the material is less dense (when light speeds up). Because different wavelengths (colors) of light travel through a medium at different speeds, the amount of bending is different for different wavelengths. Violet is bent the most and red the least because violet light has a shorter wavelength, and short wavelengths travel more slowly through a medium than longer ones do. Because white light is made up of ALL visible wavelengths, its colors can be separated (dispersed) by this difference in behavior.

The screen is necessary for the image to be formed. Without a screen there is no image. 21.An image can be seen on the screen regardless of where the screen is placed relative to the lens.

But to proceed regularly, it was necessary first to see how much light the sun loses by reflection at different distances, and what are the matters which reflect it the strongest; I first found, that glasses when they are polished with care, reflect the light more powerfully than the best polished metals, and even better than the compounded metal with which telescope mirrors are made; and that although there are two reflectors in the glasses, they yet give a brighter and more clear light than metal. Secondly, by receiving the light of the sun in a dark place, and by comparing it with this light of the sun reflected by a glass, I found, that at small distances, as four or five feet, it only lost about half by reflection, which I judged by letting a second reflected light fall on the first; for the briskness of these two reflected lights appeared to be equal to that of direct light. Thirdly, having received at the distances of 100, 200, and 300 feet, this light reflected by great glasses, I perceived that it did not lose any of its strength by the thickness of the air it had to pass through.

Here's Cowley explaining on Space Weather how a \"glass bead bow\" can form: \"Crews marking paint lines on roads often scatter small glass beads onto the paint. The glass beads retro-reflect light and this enhances the visibility of the markings at night. The glass beads \u2013 if sufficiently spherical \u2013 also produce rainbows. The difference is that the refractive index of glass is greater than that of water and the bow is only about 21\u00b0 in radius compared to the rainbow's 42\u00b0. The glow around the shadow of Geoff's head is an antisolar point phenomenon... produced by refraction through the glass spheres.\" The other conclusion is that particles of highly refractive material \u2013 perhaps quartz crystals \u2013 have blown over from a nearby road bed and settled into tiny fissures in the path, causing the weird illumination.

I have always observed that the shadow of glass blocks becomes darker as the glass is moved away from the surface where the shadow falls. And I know this is because refracted light rays from the glass block leave the block at an angle which creates the shadow of the glass block in the first place. However, whenever I try to observe the shadow of a glass block I can clearly see a dark outline of the block formed by its edges, irrespective of the distance from the surface where the shadow falls. And it is this outline, I seek an explanation for. Why is it that no matter how the glass block is oriented or how far it is from the surface where its shadow falls, its edges always form a distinct shadow? A: Not all the light shining on the top surface of your glass block can pass straight through the block. Inside the block, total internal reflection occurs at the side faces. The light which was \"supposed\" to exit through the sides is refracted to the inside. This causes the shadow you observe and a slighly brighter middle section, which is hard to see. In fact, you might be able to see a brighter rim on the inside of the side's shadows if you move the block very close to the table.

Actually I had asked in another post that \"Does infrared rays pass through active shutter glass\" but someone just commented that infrared rays dont pass through polarized glass. If infrared rays doesnt pass through polarized glass can someone explain the reason or give reference link to look through. A: Infra-red radiation will pass through a polarised medium just like visible light does i.e. the component at right angles to the plane of polarisation will be blocked. So there's nothing special about the fact the glasses are polarised. However most materials are only transparent over a restricted range of wavelengths. Optical glass only transmits light with a wavelength from about 300nm to around 2500nm. There's a good article on the optical properties of glass here. However I think passive 3D glasses are made from conventional polarisers, which are made from a polymer called polyvinyl alcohol. I struggled to find much about the spectra of PVA polarisers, though I found this article that lists some polarisers that work down to 3000nm. So it seems PVA polarisers will transmit at least the near infra-red. However the term infra-red covers a huge range of wavelengths from 750nm - 1mm. I can't think of anything, even air, that is transparent right across this range of wavelengths so everything absorbs infra-red light to some extent.

How does a one-sided glass work? If seen from the outer side, we can see through thinking it is transparent, while if seen from the inside, the glass acts as a mirror. How? A: A one way mirror isn't really a one way mirror. It lets the same amount of light through in both directions. It works because one side of the mirror is light while the other is dark. Suppose you're on the light side looking at the mirror, and suppose that the light side is 99 times as bright as the dark side. Finally assume the mirror lets through half the light and reflects half the light. The light from the dark side hits the mirror and half gets through, so the (relative) intensity passing through the mirror is 0.5%. The light around you (in the bright room) hits the mirror and half of it reflects back, so the (relative) intensity of your reflection is 49.5% or 99 times greater than the light from the dark room. Since the human eye isn't good at dealing with large contrasts, your reflection completely swamps the light from the dark side and you can't see through the mirror - all you can see is your own reflection. If you're looking at the mirror from the dark side excatly the opposite argument applies. The light passing through the mirror from the bright side has an intensity of 49.5% while your own reflection has an intensity of 0.5%.

It is the dispersion of light by ordinary glass that is responsible for the familiar splitting of light into its component colors by a prism. Given n lines L and a point P L on each line, find the locus of points Q such that the lengths of the line segments QP L satisfy certain conditions. Light can be transmitted along an optical fibre with almost zero energy loss. This means that a person can be diagnosed and treated through a small incision cut. The critical angle is: If, instead of your finger, a high-speed bullet passes through the light beam, the resulting shadow will move even faster. The speeds of the shadow in the above example are still well below c , but you can extend this analogy to a wall 20 m away where the beam is 40 m in diameter or to a wall 2,, m away. Of course, a flashlight that would have measureable intensity over a wide angle at that distance would blind individuals near it, but one could still imagine the situation. It is, after all, analagous to a star that radiates uniformly in all directions with an appreciable intensity at exceptionally far distances. A planet or a giant cloud of interstellar dust passing between that star and the observer would cast a shadow, however small, that could move faster than c at the observer's location.

Newton solved the problem by swapping the lenses for curved mirrors so that the light rays did not have to pass through glass but reflected off it. At around the same time, the Dutch scientist CHRISTIAAN HUYGENS came up with the convincing but wholly contradictory theory that light travels in waves like ripples on a pond. Newton vigorously challenged anyone who tried to contradict his opinion on the theory of light, as Robert Hooke and Leibniz, who shared similar views to Huygens found out. Given Newton\u2019s standing, science abandoned the wave theory for the best part of two hundred years. 1704 \u2013 \u2018Optiks\u2019 published. In it he articulates his influential (if partly inaccurate) particle or corpuscle theory of light. Newton suggested that a beam of light is a stream of tiny particles or corpuscles, traveling at huge speed. If so, this would explain why light could travel through a vacu\u00fcm, where there is nothing to carry it. It also explained, he argued, why light travels in straight lines and casts sharp shadows \u2013 and is reflected from mirrors. His particle theory leads to an inverse square law that says that the intensity of light varies as the square of its distance from the source, just as gravity does. Newton was not dogmatic in Optiks, and shows an awareness of problems with the corpuscular theory.

My suspicion is that the ghost images are from reflections off the glass on your mirror. The entire image is getting ghosted (not just your LED), but the ghosts are weak (~5% of the normal reflection), so you can only see it for the bright green light on the black background.

How do you know when it's time to get glasses? Short answer is, get an eye exam. If your eyes are bugging you in any way, it's time to get them checked out! But sometimes our vision changes without us realizing. Sometimes we just need a little more light for doing close-up work. Either way, you shouldn't be straining or squinting. Seeing well is important for healthy eye development and can be a matter of life and death, if you're a driver. So you're wondering \"Do I need glasses?\" You might, but there are a myriad of reasons why. The main cause of vision problems are refractive errors. When light passes through an object, it bends. This is called refraction. Light must pass through the cornea and the lens and reach the retina in order for you to see. When the shape of the eyeball or the cornea prevents light from focusing directly on the retina, that is a refractive error. The natural aging of the lens can also cause refractive errors. Being nearsighted (also called Myopia.) Nearsightedness means that you can see things that are close but they become blurrier the further away they get. Being farsighted (also called Hyperopia.)

In the context of TIRFM, only fluorophores close to the interface will be readily excited by the evanescent field, while those past ~100 nm will be highly attenuated. Light emitted by the fluorophores will be undirected, and thus will pass through the objective lens at varying locations with varying intensities. This signal will then pass through the dichromatic mirror and onward to the detector. Cover Slip & Immersion Oil Glass cover slips typically have a reflective index around , while the immersion oil refractive index is a comparable . The medium of air, which has a refractive index of , would cause refraction of the excitation beam between the objective and the coverslip, thus the oil is used to buffer the region and prevent superfluous interface interactions before the beam reaches the interface between coverslip and sample. Objective Lens The objective lens numerical aperture (NA) specifies the range of range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light. To achieve the greatest incident angles, it is desirable to pass light at an off-axis angle through the peripheries of the lens.

Free-Form Shape Cold-Bent Structural Silicone Glazed Fa\u00e7ades - Design Concept and Challenges This is more obvious when we stack glass panes on top of each other; they transmit light but prevent visual connection. Similarly, cast glass produced in larger thicknesses can create more distortion compared to thinner float glass, due to the larger distance the light has to travel through the medium. Given the fact that a flat glass surface can transmit, absorb and reflect the light, the more the layers the greater the optical illusions (Brzezicki 2017). This phenomenon is evident in cavity geometries, such as hollow glass, where the double panes create more reflections and alter the perceived image, or alternatively, in the overall configuration of the structure. A monolithic cast glass wall would create less distortion than a wall of the same thickness comprising of fins and plates under certain angles of view; the more the overlapping elements, the greater the optical phenomena (Fig. 11).

The rod is glowing bright red; the glass is glowing a relatively dim orange. In fact, if we look carefully, we see that the part of the glass immediately next to the end of the rod actually looks dark; that part of the glass may be the coolest part, though it's certainly at least as hot as the rod end. The visible orange glow seems to be limited to the portion a finger's width away from the end of the rod, where we might expect the glass to be substantially hotter than the rod. So, what can we say? The glass is apparently transparent, or nearly so; it is glowing, but apparently quite a bit less strongly than the metal rod embedded in it. The second law predicts that transparent glass should glow less brightly than the opaque rod, and that to the extent that the glass glows, it must not be fully transparent. While these photos don't let us conclude anything quantitative about either the brightness or transparency of the glass, they seem to be consistent with what was predicted. Unfortunately we also can't tell from these pictures whether the glass has become any less transparent when heated to the point of glowing.

We tend to take windows for granted, without giving much thought to how they benefit us. In essence, windows allow light to enter a structure, while blocking the movement of heat. They prevent heat transfer by three different mechanisms. First, as a physical barrier to the outward movement of the indoor air, they block loss of heat by convection. Secondly, because glass conducts heat poorly, the loss of heat by conduction is slow. Finally, the most common types of glass, while transparent to visible light, strongly absorb infrared (heat) radiation. Thus, glass inhibits the loss of heat by radiation from the contents of the room. Without glass windows, we either must live in totally enclosed rooms, lit only by artificial lighting (which has its own problems), or we must let light in through simple openings, which also allow hard-won heat to escape. In 1632, glass windows were expensive enough so that only a chosen few could enjoy their advantages. The quality of the window glass is a further indication of the power or affluence of the owner.

Monolithic glass is often provided in lieu of insulating glass because of the other curtain-wall insulation that is provided in these areas. Architects often like to include shadow boxes with dark backups into curtain-wall systems with non-reflective vision glass, rather than opaque spandrel glass, because shadow boxes can more closely mimic the appearance of the non-reflective vision glass, providing a more uniform appearance to the curtain wall. When used with lighter backups, shadow boxes add an element of depth to the curtain-wall design. The top, bottom, back and sides of the insulation or back pan are typically sealed to the surrounding framing to prevent the migration of warm moist air from within the building into the shadow box. Common shadow box problems include the following: Imperfect seals permit moist interior air to reach the shadow box area and condense on the inboard face of the spandrel glass. Such condensation can lead to staining of the spandrel glass and leakage to the interior surfaces below. It is almost inevitable that some imperfect workmanship, such as small air leaks into the shadow box, will occur because of the large number of joints in the framing, gaskets, insulation facers and other materials that must be sealed.

Diffuse lighting, on the other hand, causes objects to lose their volume, while shadows and outlines to become smoother. Six main types of light space based on the directions of light flows are formulated: directed contrast, directed, selectively directed, variable, reflected, diffuse.

Thiewes\u2019 sculptures are mounted on or in the wall and painted the same color as the gallery, making them hardly noticeable, except for their cast shadows. The sculptures exist autonomously, while also defining and interacting with the surrounding space through their placement and the use of shadow. Thiewes explores shadow as a sculptural medium; specifically how the work changes throughout the course of a day as both the natural and artificial light change in intensity, temperature, and direction. The angles created by light and shadow give the appearance of folds, an illusion that Thiewes also investigates in his drawings. George Thiewes attended several colleges in the Midwest before receiving his BFA from Mankato State College and his MFA from the School of the Art Institute in Chicago.

History Wood's glass was developed as a light filter used in communications during World War I. The glass filter worked both in infrared daylight communication and ultraviolet night communications by removing the visible components of a light beam, leaving only the \"invisible radiation\" as a signal beam. Wood's glass was commonly used to form the envelope for fluorescent and incandescent ultraviolet bulbs (\"black lights\"). In recent years, due to its disadvantages, other filter materials have largely replaced it. Composition Wood's glass is special barium-sodium-silicate glass incorporating about 9% nickel oxide. It is a very deep violet-blue glass, opaque to all visible light rays except longest red and shortest violet. It is quite transparent in the violet/ultraviolet in a band between 320 and 400 nanometres with a peak at 365 nanometres, and a fairly broad range of infrared and the longest, least visible red wavelengths. Properties and uses Wood's glass has lower mechanical strength and higher thermal expansion than commonly used glasses, making it more vulnerable to thermal shocks and mechanical damage. The nickel and barium oxides are also chemically reactive, with tendency to slowly form a layer of hydroxides and carbonates in contact with atmospheric moisture and carbon dioxide.

Another complication is that the transparency of a substance varies depending on the wavelength of the light. The same object may be transparent to some wavelengths, and opaque to others. Ordinary glass, for example, is transparent to the visible wavelengths, but does a pretty lousy job of transmitting ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Adding certain materials or coatings to the glass can make it even more selective, resulting in filters that only transmit certain colors.

Light performs the same distance in less time than is required for a single stroke of its wing.\" Dismissing for the present the theory of undulations, it will be necessary to examine the phenomena of light, regarding it as radiant matter, without reference to either of the contending theories. [Page 265] Light issues from the sun, passes through millions of miles to the earth, and as it falls upon different substances, a variety of effects are apparent. There is a certain class of bodies which obstruct the passage of the rays of light, and where light is not, a shadow is cast, and the substance producing the shadow is said to be opaque. Wood, stone, the metals, charcoal, are all examples of opacity; whilst glass, talc, and horn allow a certain number of the rays to travel through their particles, and are therefore called transparent. Nature, however, never indulges in sudden extremes, and as no substance is so opaque as not (when reduced in thickness) to allow a certain amount of light to pass through its substance, so, on the other hand, however transparent a body may be, a greater or lesser number of the rays are always stopped, and hence opacity and transparency are regarded as two extremes of a long chain; being connected together by numerous intermediate links, they pass by insensible gradations the one into the other.

Mirrors do not allow even a small amount of light to pass through them. Mirrors show regular and complete reflection. Question 2. Why do we need a shiny surface for reflection? Answer: The extent of reflection depends upon the shine and smoothness of the surface. More is the shine and smoothness of the surface, more will be the reflection.

Materials like frosted glass and some plastics are called translucent. When light strikes translucent materials, only some of the light passes through them. The light does not pass directly through the materials. It changes direction many times and is scattered as it passes through.

The surface that absorbs all the light falling on it appears to be black in colour, or in other words we say that black is a good absorber and emitter of light. When light falls on the surface it may pass through it. But it is not that all light rays would pass. Certain substances allow all rays to pass and few substances allow only certain rays to pass. Those substances which allow all rays to pass appear to be transparent. The process of allowing rays to pass through is called transmit process. For example: glass is transparent as it allows all rays to pass through it. In this figure we have tinted a plane glass. You can easily notice that tinted glass allows only a few rays to pass and on the other hand, plane glass allows all rays to pass through it.

If you were putting a fragile, heavy pane of glass into a window frame, would you place the thicker edge or the thinner edge at the bottom, where all the weight of the pane would be resting?

After scouring the beach for stones that could support their pots above the fire and not finding any, they brought ashore blocks of soda that the ship was transporting.

When actually installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed thicker side down for the sake of stability. There is anecdotal evidence that occasionally such glass has been found thinner side down, as would be caused by carelessness at the time of installation. The \"glass flows\" issue has been discussed at great length in the alt.folklore.urban newsgroup, and the consensus there (supported by citations from glass experts) is that glass does not flow at room temperature. Note, however, that glass can and does 'creep' , just like crystalline solids do, in response to a load. Furthermore, in some applications (such as some laboratory thermometers), glass gets heated above the transition temperature at which it actually does become a supercooled liquid. This can cause the calibration of thermometers to change slightly over the course of many years of use. if glass flows at a rate that allows changes to be seen with the naked eye after centuries, then changes in optical telescope mirrors should be observable (by interferometry) in a matter of days - but this also is not observed.

These are developed to have the same refractive index as glass, so they don\u2019t distort light rays passing through them and appear as a normal piece of glass. Many glass manufacturers can add laminates of flexible polymers between sheets of glass so that even if one layer does break the sheet stays intact. Bingham says the glass on the bridge was likely to have had such a coating and laminations, but it would also have been toughened. This has two benefits: it makes the glass stronger, and when it does break, it tends to form harmless chunks rather than sharp shards. Toughening essentially squashes the outer surfaces of the glass and stretches the interior. This can be done chemically, which involves dipping a sheet of glass in molten potassium nitrate, causing the sodium in the glass to migrate out into the molten material and the larger potassium atoms to migrate in. Or it can be done thermally, by rapidly cooling the surface of molten glass and allowing the inner section to cool more slowly.

But, I am here to tell you that this idea is actually a very common misconception. Allow me to explain. Older window glass is thicker at the bottom due to how it was made. Often, window glass was formed from what we call crown glass. Crown glass starts as a blob of molten glass which is then blown into a huge bubble on the end of the blowpipe. To make crown glass, the gaffer blows a large bubble and flattens the end somewhat. A punty is attached to that flattened end and the bubble is broken off the blowpipe. The gaffer reheats the glass and enlarges the hole left by the blowpipe. He then very quickly spins the glass and it opens into a giant disk.

Most solid inorganic materials are crystalline and are made up of many millions of crystals, each having an atomic structure which is highly ordered, with atomic units tessellating throughout. The shape of these units can be observed in the shape of single crystals (eg. hexagonal quartz crystals). Glass is different: it is not crystalline but made up of a continuous network of atoms that are not ordered but irregular and liquid-like. This difference in atomic structure occurs because the liquid glass is cooled so quickly that the atoms do not have time to"}, {"title": "rpj_common_crawl_2021_04", "text": "Bohemia. Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible wavelengths of light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not in general transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light, resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals, so it does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth\u2014during glass formation, the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries. The molecules can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing or colored. Glass has the ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light according to the principles of geometrical optics. Common glass has a refractive index of 1.5. According to the Fresnel equations, the reflectivity (the amount of light that gets reflected off the air-glass interface) of a sheet of glass is about 4% per surface (at normal incidence in air). This means the amount of light that gets transmitted through a glass surface (the transmissivity) is 96%. The transmissivity of a glass element with two surfaces is about 92%. Glass also finds application in optoelectronics for light-transmitting optical fibers.

See also glasses. Glass is a transparent, relatively strong, hard-wearing, essentially inert, and biologically inactive material which can be formed with very smooth and impervious surfaces. These desirable properties lead to the very many uses of glass. Glasses are uniform amorphous solid materials, usually produced when a suitably viscous molten material cools very rapidly, thereby not giving enough time for a regular crystal lattice to form. Common glass is mostly amorphous silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is the same chemical compound as quartz, or in its polycrystalline form, sand. Pure silica has a melting point of about 2000 Celsius, so two other substances are always added to the sand in the glass-making process. One is soda (sodium carbonate Na2CO3), or potash, the equivalent potassium compound, which lowers the melting point to about 1000 Celsius. However, the soda makes the glass soluble, which is obviously unhelpful, so lime (calcium oxide, CaO) is the third component, added to restore insolubility. One of the most obvious characteristics of glass is that it is transparent to visible light. This transparency is due to the fact that there are no atomic line transition states with the energy of visible light in the material that makes up glass, and the fact that glass is homogeneous on all lengthscales greater than about a wavelength of light (inhomogeneities cause light to be scattered, breaking up any coherent image transmission).

It looks and feels solid, but on the atomic level, it kind of looks more like a liquid. So how do we classify it? Derek explains in the latest episode of Veritasium. You might have heard people talking about glass being a liquid before, as the idea is often used to explain why ancient stained glass windows are thicker at the bottom - over time, some people believe, the glass has very slowly been flowing downwards. It sounds like it could make sense, but as Derek explains, this just isn't true. In fact, we can still use telescopes from hundreds of years ago to accurately look at the stars, because glass holds its shape so incredibly well. So what is it about glass that makes people think it's a liquid? It all comes down to its atoms, which aren't arranged in a nice crystalline structure like they are in most solids.

We pretty much see them everywhere nowadays--our windows, our windshields, our mirrors, our fancy wine bottles. But now, it seems, glass is going to suffer some stiff competition from something that, until quite recently, exists only in science fiction: transparent aluminum. But before finding out just how stiff the competition is going to be, let's look up the basic pros and cons of glass, in no particular order: Glass lets light through, so that our houses don't look like caves on the inside. Glass also focuses light, which makes for deadly heat-based weaponry. Glass is transparent, so that we can see how we look. Glass breaks easily, so unless you have a floor full of good, thick carpeting, you'd best find yourself another mirror. Glass can't react well to pressure, which is why deep-sea submariners like Alvin have only very small windows.

If they are examined again after a certain number of hours, the smaller globules will generally be found to have retained their transparency, while the larger ones will have become opaque, in consequence of the sulphur having undergone some internal spontaneous change. But the most remarkable circumstance attending this experiment is that the globules are found adhering to the upper glass only; the reason of which is that the upper glass is somewhat cooler than the lower one, by which means we see that the vapor of sulphur is very powerfully repelled by heated glass. The flattened form of the particles is owing to the force with which they endeavor to recede from the lower glass, and their consequent pressure against the surface of the upper one.

While the glass can re-radiate, the glass needed to maintain pressures within is likely to be quite thick and therefore well-insulating. No more guessing. This chart gives you numbers.

What ends up as large, sweeping glass panels in a high-rise office building, healthcare facility, school or other construction project starts as a simple combination of sand, soda ash, limestone, dolomite and some other minor ingredients. How Glass is Made \u2013 From Cutting to Low-e Coatings In How Glass is Made, From the Batch House to the Lehr we covered how glass starts as a simple combination of sand, soda ash, limestone and dolomite, moves to the batch house, enters the furnace, and then goes through the melting, fining, forming, annealing, and cooling processes. What Glass Does with Solar Energy There are three parts to the solar energy spectrum: infrared, visible and ultraviolet. Glass consequently responds to these three different types of light in three different ways: by reflecting, absorbing or transmitting it. Tints and coatings can be used to impact that response in order to improve overall glass performance.

I wonder why Metals with different colors perhaps do not absorb different doses of temperatures? and as a consequence, when different metals of different colors are exposed to strong radiation it is not so differently warmed? A: Klein's point was that the heating of cars in sunlight is dominated by their glass windows. This is exactly the same mechanism as in a greenhouse. The glass allows visible light to pass through. The visible light is absorbed by the interior and heats it up, but the glass blocks infra-red light so the heat can't escape. The colour metal is painted will affect how much radiation it absorbs and therefore how fast it heats up. It's just that this is a small part of heating up a car so the colour the car is painted makes only a tiny difference."}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Some photos taken of the process of casting with glass wax- the melting glass wax, the casts full of glass wax, and photos of the failed jaw bone casts and brick cast.

I will try one more time to cast it hollow but a bit thicker and if that doesn\u2019t work I might have to cast it solid instead.

A[i][j] = 0 if there is no mouse in cell (i, j), else it is 1, if there is a single mouse. LE is scared of a mouse if he moves into a position (x, y) where the distance between himself and the mouse <= 1. Given that he needs to reach the bottom right corner of the grid (N-1, M-1), and that he takes only right/down moves, find the minimum number of mice he will be scared by along such a path. # Explanation: In order to solve this, let us first make a visualization: each mouse casts a \"shadow\" of length 1 in all four directions. Thus, LE gets scared of a mouse iff his path passes through its \"shadow\". Note that if it passes through the mouse itself, then it would have had to come through some shadow, and further it would go through some shadow, so we can consider it as if it has passed through the shadow only. Thus, let us assume that we have a shadow grid, where shadow[i][j] = Number of mice that cast a shadow on cell (i, j). Finding the number of mice that LE is scared of, is then just summing up values of shadow!! Well, nearly that. The fact is, we are double-counting.

The PC version has been released September 29, 2014. The Wii U version was released worldwide on January 28, 2016. Gameplay The game can be played both in single-player mode or shared screen local co-op. A boy and his shadow have to cooperate to make their way and find the evil shadow puppeteer. Together they need to solve puzzles based on manipulating three types of lightsources and three shadow tools called \"stencils\" in-game. The puzzles are a mix of 2D and 3D, as the boy is free to move in any direction, while the shadow is limited to being projected on 2D surfaces and using shadows cast by objects as platforms. Moving an object also moves its shadow. Similarly, moving a shadow can move the object casting it. In order to solve the puzzles, the players can also manipulate the light sources and alter the dimensions of the shadows. On their way, the boy and the shadow pass through 5 different worlds. Each world introduces new elements the players need to master. An example would be a shadow scissors which allows the shadow to cut shadow strings. Another element would be the shadow bombs, which allow the shadow to destroy both the shadow of a wall and the wall itself. In their path, the two characters also have to fight shadow monsters.

The principal wall material unlike many of Waterhouse's contemporary designs is a dark mahogany/brown brick combined with beautiful red/brown plane tiles and gables which are heavily half-timbered and pargetted with rough cast. Interestingly, Waterhouse was to choose a similar brick when he built his own house \"The Gables\" in Neutral Bay - between 1920 and 1923. The tall chimneys have their own gabled roofs and are almost a trademark of a Waterhouse design from this period.

Live audiences, primarily consisting of elementary and middle school-aged students, learn about an understudied time, place, and art form. They come away from the experience with a heightened appreciation for the arts and greater esteem for the Spanish language and the diverse cultures across the globe that claim it as their native tongue. Professors looking for experiential learning opportunities for their students will discover that outreach through shadow puppets is an excellent way to connect their students to Spanish-speaking communities. This includes training students to become performers themselves. 8 In just a few hours, an inexperienced cast of would-be puppeteers can learn how to perform with shadow puppets. In May 2019, Dragoncillo visited Buena Vista University and briefly rehearsed Second Hands and the Ladies' Man with university students, preparing them to perform at elementary schools in Storm Lake, Iowa, and the surrounding areas. The contagious laughter, thoughtful questions, and generous praise from the audience created a unique and beneficial experience for the performers and audience members alike. Each performer had the opportunity to practice using a shadow puppet, impart dialogue, and teach about a critical period of Hispanic theater history. Each audience member was able to experience a shadowpuppet performance, ask pertinent questions, and learn about Golden Age Spain. Dragoncillo's bilingual approach to outreach ensures that students of all backgrounds recognize the rich cultural history and artistic inheritance of the Spanish language.

For example, as LK already mentioned, Aurora already has way more personality than brick wall terra ever did. Serin, who is probably my favorite of the original cast, is delightfully disconnected from reality at almost all times, and yet somehow has the ability (or the luck) to come through in the clutch when things get serious-time.

In these cases, mix your easy gray with French Ultramarine blue and Burnt Sienna, emphasizing the blue. ### Two Exceptions to the Rule There are two exceptions to this rule. The first deals with transparency and translucency. In a transparent or translucent object, both the body shadow and the cast shadow are affected by the fact that light passes through the object rather than being blocked. There is no shadow side on an object when light passes through it; a translucent object, such as a flower petal, will actually be brighter on that side. Light passing through transparent color will also throw both color and light into the cast shadow. (See Still Life with Peaches.) The second exception has to do with the tendency of nearby colors to reflect into each other in very strong light. In the study of the blue mug below you will notice that some of the pink of the cloth is reflected into the mug. In the painting of the orange in the page following, the shiny orange is picking up a strong reflected light from the napkin underneath it and bouncing it back down into the cast shadow. Study the shadows of a blue mug on a pink cloth. Notice how the pink cloth reflects back into the mug.

Once SketchUp Shadows are on, shadow direction will stream through the portals. To cast daylight through a ceiling, convert that interior ceiling into a group.

I will have you look at the cast carefully now, and I want you to see that if you squint that plane beneath his jaw fades away into the shadow itself. Only when you open your eyes fully, does it appear different. Now, one of the reasons for this is that direct light is always stronger than reflected light. So the light here or here or here, here, here, any of this is always going to be a lighter value than any reflected light within the shadow pattern. So one way of thinking of it is that nothing, not even the lightest light within your shadow can be as light as the darkest, dark within your halftime. Nothing in your light can be as dark as the lightest form in the shadow. Oh, but that looks just as light. You'll say, when you look at it with your eyes open. Squint and you'll see, it's not. And it cannot be because after all, how could reflect the light equal or surpass the light value of direct light. At most, the reflected light is only a reflection of direct light.

In rooms with several computer screens inside the task area special care has to be taken in the positioning of the luminaries to avoid luminous reflections from the screens. In using portable computers the viewing directions may change in relation to the fixed luminaires and this poses further requirements for lighting design. Also, when rearranging the working places and geometry of the working conditions, the possible causes of veiling reflections should be avoided in the typical viewing directions. With proper lighting design, i.e. positioning of luminaires related to working areas, it is possible to achieve the same visibility conditions with less energy than with incorrect positioning of luminaires causing veiling reflections to the working area. Shadows in the space may be negative in obstructing the visibility of certain elements, but they can also be positive in creating an attractive and interesting visual environment. Whether shadows are considered as visually comfortable or discomfortable depends much on the application. A good balance between direct light and diffuse light is important in order to see the way light falls on objects. In the quest for more parameters of lighting quality, it is worthwhile to study the shadows of objects in a deeper way: the light side of an object, the shadow side, the cast shadow and the presence of reflected light. This can give more connections between scientific and artistic knowledge of lighting qualities.

Imagine illuminating an object from several directions all at once. The sources could be from windows or largely separated lamps. We call this diffused illumination. As easy as it sounds, front lighting is easily explained. For instance, imagine a source of light in front of an object. That is to say, the nearer surface receives more light than the rearer which is in shade. This illumination is front lighting. The light rays illuminate the rear side of an object as they move towards an observer. Thus, the frontal surface falls in shade and casts distinct shadows towards the observer. Imagine an object resting on a white table. The light from the table reflects back to the object, making the shadow side lighter. Similarly, if an object rests on a black or dark table, the middle tones become a dark reflection. This is widely used to formulate theories of light, shade and shadow casting.

However, it is not clear whether these assumptions are used in the perception of cast shadows. Moreover, it is unclear whether a perceptual interaction exists between shading and cast shadows because until now they have been studied separately. In this study, we investigated through three experiments whether the light-from-above (or another direction) assumption is used in interpreting ambiguous cast shadows, and whether shading information influences the interpretation of cast shadows. Our results indicate the existence of the light-from-above assumption in interpreting cast shadows. Consistent shading information enhanced the interpretation, and judgments of lighting direction were also based on both cast shadow and shading information. However, the perceptual determination of shape from shading was relatively independent of the cast shadow interpretation or the lighting direction judgments of the scene. Introduction Humans receive spatial information from shading and shadows as depth cues. Shading is defined as ''the variation of reflected light on a surface patch which faces directly the light source' ' (p. 289;Mamassian, Knill, & Kersten, 1998). Conversely, shadows can be classified as either attached or cast. When a part of the object surface is darker because the object itself occludes the light, this is called an attached shadow. When a shadow is produced on a distant surface, this is called a cast shadow.

Newer LED lightbulbs are often labeled with how \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d (yellow-orange or blue-green) the light is, but this is not a novel technological phenomenon. The color temperature of light coming from the sun changes constantly during the day, in different seasons, and in different weather conditions, because of the angle of the sun and the amount and quality of atmosphere that the light is passing through. The effect of lighting on the color of objects is sometimes very counter-intuitive. We would expect the shadow cast on a white object to be rendered in a shade of gray, since gray is a darker tone of the local color white. Renoir adheres to this expectation in rendering the shadows in the folds and pleats of the woman\u2019s dress in his earlier painting. But in fact shadows cast on white objects are frequently blue. This effect is particularly noticeable when we observe fresh snow on a sunny day, but it is also clearly evident in Renoir\u2019s The Swing (1876).

We found that convex was chosen as the perceived shape of a disk with shading in almost all conditions as shown in Table 1. The results are not predicted from the light-from-above assumption that suggests concave in the white-on-bottom condition. We suggest three reasons why the white-on-bottom disks did not tend to appear as a concave shape. First, all disks in the stimulus image had the same gradation direction. In previous studies, stimulus images used in experiments included disks with gradations in both directions on the same screen. Second, convex superiority might dominate in this experiment; that is, we tend to regard objects as convex because there are few concave objects in the world. Third, cast shadows disturb the perception of a concave shape, as noted earlier. However, this convex-biased determination of shape from shading contradicts the results from Experiment B. From the viewpoint of determining shape from shading, the convex perception means that the light comes from the lighter side of the disk. As the convex superiority was constant across the cast shadow position conditions, the lighting direction was always assumed to be the lighter side direction.

The shadow surface is typically the same plane on which the object is placed. A new self shadow method is proposed in this paper in which the shadow surface is on the occluding object itself. We show that it works even for lighting environments where the cast shadow method fails while clarifying the stability issues related to sampling resolution, and the selection of lighting model.

Unfortunately, our lighting equations would become horribly complex if we had to do collision checks along the incident light ray to figure out if a light should influence a fragment or not\u2014so we have to do more hacks. The simplest hack for shadows is to assume that light comes only from one direction and goes from somewhere mostly above the object towards the ground. We project a ray from the character's feet in the direction of the light source (usually, straight down) and, wherever it hits, place a small dark (sometimes translucent) circle or oval oriented along the normal to the surface. For greater realism in case the shadow should be cast on a couple of different surfaces, we might project rays from multiple points and deploy several shadow bits. When combined with statically baked shadows, this can be fairly convincing. A more realistic way to achieve \"I'm on the ground now\" shadowing and more is screen space ambient occlusion, which I recommend looking up and reading about! We might discuss it in a couple of weeks. If we want to get more realistic shadows that take the object's shape into account, we need to do some more sophisticated tricks.

Or, to be more precise, it\u2019s very difficult to implement it in a general way that covers all the potential cases and produces consistent results. So let\u2019s start by thinking how we could check if a specific area (indeed a fragment) is in shadow or not. While drawing that area if we can cast rays to the light source and reach the light source without any collision then that pixel is in light. If not, the pixel is in shadow. The following picture shows the case for a point light: point PA can reach the source light, but points PB and PC can\u2019t so they are in shadow.

Is there any way to make the bloom 'ignore' this object and still glow through it or behind it? As you can see, without the glass it glows, with the glass it doesn't. Since bloom is a post processing effect, it happens after the whole scene has already been rendered. The reason its not working in the version with glass is because the glass is drawn after the bright light and reduces the brightness of its pixels to below the bloom threshold. You could experiment with making the glass more transparent or reducing the threshold in bloom settings, but I think the best solution would be to increase the brightness of the emission color past one. Just crank that up to like 5 or something and it should make the light bright enough to bloom through glass and in shadows and such. Make sure HDR is enabled on camera settings, also you probably will want to only use this material on lights inside glass otherwise ones outside will be insanely bright lol. Hope this helps! Yeah I might have to learn a bit about shaders to get it working. No matter how much I make it transparent (even completely see-through) it still blocks the bloom.

The diagram below explains how each segment of the path may look. You'll notice in the animation that the glass becomes truly transparent at depth four. If you look at the above illustration you'll notice the cross section of the correctly modeled glass has 4 surfaces to pass through before exiting. Since the first intersection is handled by the camera ray (corresponds to the 1 on the illustration) you would need 4 more to pass through 2, 3, and 4 and still have depth to exit the glass. This is what makes the glass transparent where we can see the ground on the other side. Let's add some diffuse bounces now. Using the PxrVCM integrator and Trace Light Paths in the PxrDomeLight, you'd expect to see caustic light patterns off of and through the glass. But with the Max Diffuse Depth at zero, there's no collection of diffuse lighting from the glass at all. Below the diffuse depth is increased for each render by one and you can see quite a dramatic difference in the amount of light collected. You may also notice that this is an artificial way to limit caustics in your scene if they become time-consuming or distracting visually.

Refraction allows a transparent object to correctly distort the image seen through it-just as a clear drinking glass bends light passing through it. EI has always had strong lighting capabilities. Universe gives you many types of lights, from spot and radial to parallel (simulates a distant light source) and tube (much like a neon tube light). Master Lights have been added, so if you have 20 lights on a building, you can link them to the same master light and adjust all of them simultaneously. Further, you can set which aspects of the Master Light each specific light will inherit. For example, you can simultaneously adjust the intensity of a group of lights that have their own individual colors. Master Materials work in much the same fashion for textures. Lights can now cast raytraced shadows. You can set drop-off, and specify the edge softness and number of samples used to calculate the shadow. Each light can be set to cast either a buffered or raytraced shadow so you can mix and match, taking the raytracing render hit only when necessary. Lights haven't been drastically improved, but that's because they"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "shadows appear to be spreading all over the scene and give the grainy look as well. so... any tips on glass atributes/textures and lightning? If you want the effect that Simon showed you'll have to use different passes for your render. Currently the ART renderer doesn't change shadow intensity depending on the transparency of an object. In other words, your glass window is casting just as many shadows as the walls around it making so no light shines through. You have to make 2 renders. One render would be your entire scene without the glass window pane. The second render could be just the window pane (or the rest of the scene as well if you really need the reflections on the window).

The latest stable release from last fall has \"stained glass\" support, i.e. if you make bmodel with \"_shadow\" \"1\" and \"_alpha\" \"0.5\", light rays going through the entity will be partly attenuated and pick up the color of the texture. So a simplified version of water attenuation would be not considering the distance traveled underwater, but just attenuate the ray when it goes through the surface.

This technique is significantly faster than ray tracing while still giving you a realistic shadow effect. But the problem with ray casting is its restrictiveness; you don't have a lot of room to work with when trying to add effects like reflections. Usually, you have to come up with some kind of compromise between ray casting and ray tracing, balancing between speed and visual effects. The major problem with both of these techniques is that WebGL does not give you access to any vertices except the currently active one. This means you either have to perform everything on the CPU (as apposed to the graphics card), or you have make a second shader that calculates all the lighting and stores the information in a fake texture. You would then need to decompress the texture data back into the lighting information and map it to the vertices. So basically, the current version of WebGL is not very well suited for this. I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying WebGL won't help you. Ray tracing can also be a viable option if your application has very few lights and objects.

If you run a level in devmap mode (type /devmap mymapname) then type /r_lightmap 1 at the console, you will see the level's lightmap. The geometry, apart from non-lightmapped shaders, will be white, with the shadows, light and colour burnt into it clearly visible. /r_lightmap 0 returns the map to normal. This lightmap is rendered onto the textures you apply to your geometry, so in a way, all textures in Q3 are blended shaders.

Still very much early days for this tech as the price for the new cards that support it is ridiculously high and puts it beyond the reach of what most people are going to be willing to spend.

Another method is to do the sampling yourself using a Poisson distribution. However, Exponential Shadow Maps go an entirely different route with this. Exponential Shadow Maps store a part of the approximation of the shadow casting test, and allows us to recombine it later for the actual approximation. The whole equation for Exponential Shadow Maps is as follows: $\\dpi{150} S_f(x) = e^{cz}e^{-cd}$ In the above algorithm, c is some constant chosen by the user, z is the actual rendered depth from the light\u2019s perspective, and d is the depth which we are testing against.

Light has always been a mystery for me. When we do a simple experiment of holding a lighter in one hand and a light source behind it, it shows no shadow on the wall at all. Why is this happening? Is it because the flame is pure energy and doesn't have matter in it, or is it due to light passing through the flame and not getting reflected? If it is, why isn't the light getting reflected or retracted? A: Imagine that you have a titanium screen. It's thin, so it's difficult to see. You can use a torch to heat some areas to incandescence. These areas become easily visible. Now if we take a very bright light source and shine them at these lit areas, we won't see a shadow that gives us any information about the pattern of the light. Both the cool and hot areas interact with the bright light beam in the same way. The grid itself may be visible, but the pattern won't reflect anything about the relationship between the dark and light regions. The flame is the same thing. It contains matter (such as fuel or soot particles), but similar matter is also present outside the flame. The imaging light may be slightly attenuated by these particles, but there is no sharp division in their location that corresponds to the shape of the flame. This lack of sharp division will prevent imaging.

Remember, there is nothing happening here but the casting of a shadow. Figure 2.5 is just the shadow that would be cast by the second screen in Figure 2.4.

Puzzling though it may be that light rays should bend when passing through small holes, it is not, I think, fundamentally disturbing. In any case, what matters for our present purposes is that it does bend. This means that shadows in general need not look like silhouettes of the objects that cast them.

There is some slight refraction--but you'll only notice it when the shadow is far from the flame and the light source is very intense (a point source). When you look at the flame, you don't see through it because the flame is so bright that your eyes only notice the flame. If your eyes and brain had a wide enough dynamic range then you could see both the flame and the things behind it. A: The flame has to have matter in it, because it is producing light itself. According to EM theory the resulting field observed (at a wall, for example) is sum of the field due to primary source and the flame. Some scattering and absorption does happen in the flame and this should lead to decrease of intensity in the region shadow would be expected. If you can't see this decreased intensity, the simplest explanation is that it is too small a difference to be detected by your eye. A: Everyone's trying to be all complicated, but it's an extremely simple answer. A shadow is nothing more than the result of light being blocked by something or another. But a flame is a light source itself. If you take a lamp bulb and a flashlight, and shine the flashlight on the lit lightbulb, the lightbulb won't produce a shadow, either.

Such effects cannot be explained with a strict ray-based theory of light, which requires rectilinear propagation of light rays without reflection or refraction. When a wave passes a point in a medium, the resulting disturbance is a source of new wave motion of the same frequency (according to the Huygens-Fresnel principle). Consider waves of water that are incident from the left on a barrier with a narrow opening. First, suppose the opening is small compared with the wavelength of the waves. The water sloshing up and down in the opening acts as a point source of new waves. As a result, concentric waves are produced on the far side of the barrier. As the opening is widened, however, waves produced on the far side no longer emanate from a pointlike source, and the resulting waves are now less circular in shape. When the opening is very wide compared with the wavelength of the waves, the waves incident from the left simply pass through the opening unobstructed and undergo only slight diffraction at the edges. For light waves, this slight diffractive effect blurs the edges of a shadow. If the light source is very small (preferably a point), dark and bright fringes will be seen. The degree of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the incident wave. For example, AM radio waves are long, ranging from 200 to 6000"}, {"title": "rpj_book", "text": "the waves proceed directly through it into the harbor following a straight line (rectilinear propagation) as waves usually do. In the second case, the size of the harbor mouth is about the same size, or smaller, than the wavelength of the incoming waves, and when this happens, it causes the characteristic pattern (diffraction) that we see in the drawing. Whenever waves pass through an opening that is so small that the wavelength of the waves passing through it seems large in comparison, the waves passing through it diffract. Since light is a wave phenomenon (according to the wave theory of light), it should behave in the same way, and it does. If we place a light source behind a cut-out like the one below, it casts a projection on the wall like this one: This is analogous to sea waves entering the large harbor mouth. The width of the cut-out is millions of times larger than the wavelength of the light. As a result, the light waves go straight through it, following straight lines and projecting onto the wall a figure with the same shape as the cut-out. Notice especially that this projection has distinct borders between the bright area and the dark area. If we make the cut-out no larger than a razor slit so that its width is roughly as small as the wavelength of the incoming light, the light diffracts.

The most common way to get a changing index of refraction in different regions of air is to heat the air. As air heats up, it expands and its index of refraction changes. A pocket of warm air sitting next to a pocket of cold air will therefore constitute regions with different indices of refraction. The interface between the cold air and the warm air will therefore bend light and cause shadows. This effect is most visible when strong direct sunlight is coming in sideways through a window, passes through cold ambient air and then passes through the hot air above a heater. The shadow that this air system creates on the far wall consists of waving, rolling lines mimicking the turbulent motion of the hot air as it rises. The index of refraction of air also changes as the pressure and composition changes, therefore these effects can also lead to air shadows. For instance, the pressure variations caused by a plane plowing through the air can cause shadows. Also, gases being vented into ambient air creates spatial variations in the air, and therefore shadow-causing variations in the index of refraction.

The slits are one-fifth of a millimetre apart, and illuminated by a parallel-sided beam of pure red light from a laser on the other side of the barrier. Why laser light and not torchlight? Only because the precise shape of a shadow also depends on the colour of the light in which it is cast; white light, as produced by a torch, contains a mixture of all visible colours, so it can cast shadows with multicoloured fringes. Therefore in experiments about the precise shapes of shadows we are better off using light of a single colour. We could put a coloured filter (such as a pane of coloured glass) over the front of the torch, so that only light of that colour would get through.

Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls. In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished them from the incandescent light. Eugen Goldstein dubbed them cathode rays. By the 1870s William Crookes and others were able to evacuate glass tubes below 10\u22126 atmospheres, and observed that the glow in the whole tube disappeared when the pressure was reduced but the glass behind the anode began to glow. Crookes was also able to show that the particles in the cathode rays were negatively charged and could be deflected by an electromagnetic field. In 1897, Joseph Thomson measured the mass of these cathode rays, proving they were made of particles.

A charge card or a debit card may also be used to transact business with a bank through use of an automated teller machine (ATM). The magnetic stripe card is capable of storing data by modifying the magnetism of magnetic particles embedded in the stripe. The data stored on the magnetic stripe may be sensed or read by swiping the stripe past a read head. The analog waveform obtained by sensing the magnetic stripe must undergo a process known as decoding to obtain the digital information stored in the magnetic stripe of the card. Currently, there are hundreds of magnetic stripe readers/swipers on the market; all of them are at least as long as the credit card itself. These existing readers/swipers can be classified as either platform card readers or plunge card readers. Platform card readers are traditional card swipers with single rails, which allow a card to be held against the base of the reader by the user and moved across the read head of the reader. Plunge swipers guide a card by two sets of rails and a backstop. Once the user has inserted the card against the backstop, the card is read as it is removed from the plunge swipers. Plunge swipers are common on ATMs and other self-pay devices because they are less prone to hacking.

It is really inexpensive to issue mag stripe cards, and nowadays the point-of-sale technology for reading mag stripes has been perfected and benefits from economies of learning and scale.\u201d The first person to affix magnetic media to a plastic card for data storage was IBM engineer Forrest Parry. This was back in the early 1960s. The story goes that he wanted to combine a strip of magnetized tape with a plastic identity card for officials of the CIA, and he couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. When he mentioned his problem to his wife, who happened to be ironing clothing at the time, she suggested that he use the iron to essentially melt the strip on. And that\u2019s what he did. IBM became a pioneer in magnetic stripe technology. The story of the magnetic stripe isn\u2019t just about the ingenuity of the technology. Even more important was the effort by IBM and other leaders of electronic payments to create open compatibility standards. Working with the banking and airlines industries, IBM helped develop the approach that was adopted as a U.S. standard in 1969 and an international standard two years later. That meant that anybody could use their magnetic stripe credit or debit card anywhere in the world. It also meant that IBM couldn\u2019t benefit directly from its magnetic stripe inventions. \u201cWe decided not to patent the stripe or the stripe production technologies.

A couple of inches above and below the magnetic stripe reader are protrusions that allow just enough room to swipe a credit card. The barriers are a negative affordance (is that the right terminology?); they make swiping a credit card awkward. I have to carefully place my card in the small space above the reader to start. After swiping I always end up jamming the card into the bottom barrier. If one wanted to apply Fitts's law to swiping a credit card, and intentionally violate it, this seems like a pretty good way to do so. Yet, there must be a reason those barriers were added, and it doesn't appear to be structural. RedBox had a problem a few years ago with people installing credit card skimming equipment on their machines. The equipment was often attached to the existing credit card reader. It was big and bulky, but a lot of people wouldn't realize that it wasn't the right hardware. I thought these barriers were put in place to prevent the skimmers. The barriers protect against the installation of credit card skimmers. When the credit card reader and blocks are positioned correctly you find that at least half of the credit card is inside the reader when you start swiping. This means that there is no way to place a skimmer on the machine that can capture the whole strip's data.

Credit cards using \"contactless\" technology allow users to pay for merchandise by holding the card near a special reader instead of swiping it or handing it to a clerk. The announcement of new \"blink\" cards by JPMorgan Chase & Co. marks the first push to introduce the cards to U.S. consumers on a wide scale. This technology is already in use to some extent in Europe and Asia. In this article, we'll find out what sets blink cards apart, whether or not they are safe to use and why credit-card companies are so interested in this new technology. Not Exactly New Tech Mobile introduced the Speedpass in 1997. Speedpass is a small device on a keychain (called a fob) that users wave in front of the Speedpass logo on gas pumps. The cost of the gas is automatically deducted from the user's Speedpass account. What is Blink? RFID and Blink Blink Security Why Blink? Courtesy Chase The new blink credit card is just like a regular credit card in many ways. It has the account holder's name and the account number embossed on the front of the card. On the back is a magnetic strip containing the account information, so the card can be used anywhere regular credit cards can be used. The key difference is inside the card.

So why institute blink technology at all? Why not just stop requiring signatures on regular credit cards? The answer may be Chase's national press release, which states, \"Research has shown that customers who use blink cards often spend more per transaction.\" In addition, the novelty of blink could lead consumers to apply for Chase credit cards so they can use the new technology. The end result is more money for the company supplying the cards. Critics point out that credit-card companies encouraging people to spend more money and to do it more quickly is not a good thing for consumers [ref]. While Chase is the first credit-card issuer to adopt RFID cards on a large scale, other companies are getting in on the action. MasterCard's PayPass and American Express' Express Pay have been implemented in select markets. What else does the future hold for contactless credit cards? The biggest impact could be seen in the form factor of credit cards. Much of the credit-card market is driven by personalized cards with images of the user's favorite sports team, national parks and other graphics that create additional appeal. Without the restriction of the magnetic strip, credit \"cards\" could come in any shape, from keychain fobs to miniature toys or sculptures to coins that fit easily into a pocket.

Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented in Denmark around 1900 for recording audio.[1] In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960, IBM used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards,[2] under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions. Magnetic storage was known from World War II and computer data storage in the 1950s.[2] In 1969 Forrest Parry, an IBM engineer, had the idea of securing a piece of magnetic tape, the predominant storage medium at the time, to a"}, {"title": "rpj_common_crawl_2020_05", "text": "first place.

In the 80s and early 90s, credit cards would be imprinted onto a carbon piece of paper that the customer would sign off on. By signing the carbon paper, the customer authorized the vendor to charge money from his or her account. This method proved to be unsecure and problematic, as it produced pages of sensitive credit card details. If someone misplaced or did not properly dispose of your credit card slip, a thief could use your carbon paper to steal information. As technology progressed, we moved away from carbon copies and shifted to magnetic strips. Up until the last decade, magnetic strips have been relatively safe and effective. Your credit card details are inside the strip and are transmitted to a computer or machine after swiped on a card reader. Unfortunately, as technology has progressed, so has criminal ingenuity. There are now a number of third party programs, or devices attached to card readers, that save your sensitive information and send it to high-tech thieves. To combat the surge in credit card fraud, many financial institutions around the world have adopted cards that meet the EMV security standards. Embedded smart chips help protect your information by encrypting all of your sensitive banking information.

Using a different approach, Recursion\u2019s experts created a credit-card-sized jamming device for the wallet that prevents cards from responding to any reader.

You need to understand how older credit cards worked to know why chip-and-PIN is considered \u201cmore secure\u201d than previous credit cards.

The magnetic stripe, sometimes called swipe card or magstripe, is read by swiping past a magnetic reading head. Magnetic stripe cards are commonly used in credit cards, identity cards, and transportation tickets. They may also contain an RFID tag, a transponder device and/or a microchip mostly used for business premises access control or electronic payment. Magnetic recording on steel tape and wire was invented in Denmark around 1900 for recording audio.[1] In the 1950s, magnetic recording of digital computer data on plastic tape coated with iron oxide was invented. In 1960, IBM used the magnetic tape idea to develop a reliable way of securing magnetic stripes to plastic cards,[2] under a contract with the US government for a security system. A number of International Organization for Standardization standards, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO 8583, and ISO/IEC 4909, now define the physical properties of the card, including size, flexibility, location of the magstripe, magnetic characteristics, and data formats. They also provide the standards for financial cards, including the allocation of card number ranges to different card issuing institutions.

EMV cards feature a built-in microprocessing chip that helps keep your information safe and secure. These types of cards are the standard throughout the world -- with the exception of the US.

That\u2019s actually caused by a positive reason: fraud rates in the US are low compared to other countries. There was less incentive for banks (and cardholders) here to make the switch to EMV cards. Understanding How the Technology Works Chip-and-PIN authentication keeps credit cards secure in two ways. The chip itself allows the card to communicate with the card reader when you insert your plastic into the machine. The information on the chip is dynamic, which means it changes. It also interacts with the card reader to actively create and encrypt the information it shares with the machine. The chip in your card creates a unique transaction code every time you swipe it. This code is only valid for that one transaction. Even if this information is stolen, it\u2019s pretty useless -- using it again would cause a payment to be declined. The \u201cPIN\u201d part comes next. Once the chip communicates with the card reader and the system authorizes the transaction, you provide your PIN. If your PIN doesn\u2019t line up to the PIN required to use the card, the system won\u2019t authorize the transaction.

With magnetic stripes on everything from MasterCards to subway tickets -- and magnets built into many everyday objects -- demagnetization can be an accident just waiting to happen. \"There are some environments where it's fairly easy to demagnetize a card,\" says Kevin Rhoads, a research engineer at Dartmouth University in New Hampshire. But how does magnetic energy result in the ruination of a card? It all has to do with the nature of the magnetic stripe itself. The black stripe on the back is filled with data about your account, from the name of the card issuer to the limits on your card. This data is arranged on the stripe using tiny magnetic particles, so exposure to an external magnet can throw the information out of place and render the card unreadable. \"If you disturb the way that the particles were aligned in the first place by putting a magnet close to it, it will disrupt that encoding,\" says"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Earthmover Credit Union Visa\u00ae Credit Cards now come with built-in chip technology.

Square is hoping to capitalize on this transition by being one of the first companies out of the gate in the US to offer small and medium-sized business owners a smaller, less-expensive alternative to buying a whole new set of credit card terminals.

If you do not have a chip card \u2013 don\u2019t fret \u2013 credit/debit card machines and ATMs accept both chip cards and cards with magnetic stripes. If you have a chip card, you will start inserting your card into the enabled terminals when making a purchase. If your card does not have a chip, you will continue to swipe your card at point of purchase. They are used in over 130 countries around the world. They still work at terminals where only magnetic stripe transactions are accepted. It is a very secure method of payment. The chip card technology is not a locator system. The technology is strictly limited to supporting the authentication of card data during a purchase.

And if you used plastic or disposable bags (rather than bags you brought on your own), you have to pay 5 cents per bag. The District passed a law requiring as much in 2009 -- a policy that states like New Jersey and New York are also considering, and that has been adopted around the world from Ireland and Scotland to South Africa. Some localities have gone farther still -- California and Hawaii have effectively banned plastic bags outright -- but recent research suggests that charges or fees can also be effective (and have the added benefit of being less coercive). Moreover, it suggests that they work, at least in part, through a surprising mechanism. It's not just the relatively minor added cost, on its own, that impels people to stop using plastic bags and to instead bring their own bags with them to the store. Rather, it's the way this small change disrupts habitual behaviors and helps people draw a tighter linkage between the environmental awareness that they already possess, and actions in the world that actually advance that consciousness and their values.

Though they seem small and light, plastic bags have a much larger environmental footprint than you may imagine, beginning with the energy required to make them. Twelve million barrels of oil are used to manufacture the plastic bags consumed in the United States each year, according to Waste Management Northwest. On a smaller scale, according to SPREP.org, you could drive a car a mile for the same amount of gasoline it takes to manufacture 14 plastic bags.

Plastic bags come in two basic types: thick bags used for clothes, CD's, electrical appliances and other goods, and thin bags used by supermarkets and take-away food stores. The story of plastic bags begins with the mining of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas. The by-product of fossil fuel production is ethylene, a carbon-hydrogen compound. Ethylene is then turned into polyethylene, a long chain carbo-hydrogen molecule whose atoms are tightly bound together. It's the tightness of the bonds that make plastic so indestructible. Polyethylene is made into plastic pellets, which are then used to make plastic bags. Recycling cuts out part of this process. To recycle plastic from supermarket or checkout bags, bags are shredded and then heated and re-extruded into plastic pellets. These pellets can be used in the manufacture of pipes, bags, film, bins, ducts, bottles, building, marine, automotive parts and more bags. Bags going to recycling need to be clean and empty. Any bags containing food scraps or shopping dockets will just be thrown away adding to the time and resources needed for recycling. Thicker shopping bags, such as bags from clothing, appliances and record stores, can't be recycled; adding these to the collection just contaminates the batch being sent for recycling. \u2022 Clean out any food scraps or dockets from your plastic bags.

Invented in Sweden in 1962, the single-use plastic shopping bag was first popularized by Mobil Oil in the 1970s in an attempt to increase its market for polyethylene, a fossil-fuel-derived compound. Many American customers disliked the plastic bag when it was introduced in 1976, disgusted by the checkout clerks having to lick their fingers when pulling the bags from the rack and infuriated when a bag full of groceries would break or spill over. But retailers continued to push for plastic because it was cheaper and took up less space than paper, and now a generation of people can hardly conceive of shopping without being offered a plastic bag at the checkout counter. The popularity of plastic grocery bags stems from their light weight and their perceived low cost, but it is these very qualities that make them unpleasant, difficult, and expensive to manage.

Consumers like to support likeminded businesses, and environmental issues are a cause a lot of people can get behind.

Plastic packaging, which keeps food fresh without preservatives and protected, free from bacteria, has also transformed the food industry by making it possible for people in developing countries to raise their living standards by exporting food cheaply to the developed world, with significant benefit to their economies. Trade, which is growing thanks to plastic, is better than aid. Car body parts, dashboards, bumpers, engine parts, and fuel tanks are all made from plastic to maintain their strength but, at the same time, reduce the weight of cars. And similar items are enabling aerospace companies to make planes, trains, and lorries lighter and more efficient. That means transport needs less fuel causing less pollution, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and costs. Even electric cars use less power the lighter they are. Another result is fewer deaths and injuries on the roads because of the use of plastic in things such as car body parts used as &lsquo;crumple zones&rsquo; and in airbag technology. Your mobile phone, your iPad, your computer are all lighter, smarter, smaller and more durable, again thanks to plastic.

As a result of these programs, we recycled more than 7 million pounds of plastic film, bags and wrap from shipping, store operations and customers in 2018 alone. Plastic Bag & Hanger Recycling: When a customer leaves our store, the bags they\u2019re holding are made from 30-50 percent recycled, unbleached plastic. Customers can also drop plastic bags in the in-store recycling bins and leave their hangers with us to reuse and recycle. Paperless Credit Statement: We also reduce waste by reminding Kohl\u2019s cardholders they can opt for paperless billing. Since 2014, we have issued more than 200 million electronic credit card statements. More than a quarter of all cardholders now receive their statements electronically. Additionally, all customers can opt into receiving e-receipts when they shop in store at Kohl\u2019s. To learn how to opt into paperless billing visit kohls.com. Beauty Products: Materials that were once destined for landfill now find a second life. Fragrance testers, nail polish and soaps are recycled into paints, floor cleaners and deodorizing sprays. Fabric Scrap Recycling: The business of influencing fashion yields thousands of fabric scraps. Associates in fabric-cutting locations are sorting scraps and recycling them. Depending on the scrap size and design print, material is reused or turned into things like building or automobile insulation. In 2018, we collected nearly one ton of fabric scraps from our New York and Milwaukee locations.

These shotgun shells using paper hulls were nearly always roll crimped, although fold crimping also eventually became popular. The primers on these paper hull shotgun shells also changed from the pistol primers used on the early brass shotgun shells to a primer containing both the priming charge and an anvil, unlike rifle and pistol ammunition, making the shotgun shell primer taller. Card wads, made of felt and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various times, gradually giving way to plastic over powder wads, with card wads, and, eventually, to all plastic wads. Starting in the early 1960s, plastic hulls started replacing paper hulls for the majority of shotgun shells and by the 1980s, plastic hulls had become universally adopted. Typical construction Modern shotgun shells typically consist of a plastic hull, with the base covered in a thin brass or plated steel covering. As noted previously, paper shells used to be common, and are still made, as are solid brass shells. Some companies have produced what appear to be all-plastic shells, although in these there is a small metal ring cast into the rim of the shell to provide strength. Often the more powerful loads will use \"high brass\" shells, with the brass extended up further along the sides of the shell, while light loads will use \"low brass\" shells. The brass does not actually provide a significant amount of strength, but the difference in appearance provides shooters with a way to quickly differentiate between high and low powered ammunition.

Considering the number of wipes used in the United States (about 5,000 per baby), that's a lot of landfill. The most earth- and baby-friendly alternative, Yarrow says, is to make your own by cutting cotton fabric into small squares and washing them when dirty. At the very least, when just a quick swipe of a wipe is needed for easy cleanups, rip a wipe in half.

This is sometimes prone to adverse effects, like the separation of the masterbatch and the base material in the machine's hopper. The masterbatch can be also added directly to the machine's screw, as a free-flowing solid or, if the masterbatch is liquid, by a peristaltic pump. Such use of liquid masterbatches allows highly accurate dosing and quick change of color between machine runs. Masterbatches can be used in most processes, except rotational molding and Plastisol and other liquid resin systems. Masterbatch production Masterbatches are produced in accordance with the required standards in the plastics industry and, if provided, to customer specifications. The general process for the manufacture of masterbatches involves the following steps: the identification and weighing of the required pigments and/or additives, the mixing of these pigments or additives into a carrier resin or polymer by heat treatment and twin-screw extrusion, the cooling and forming of the concentrated mixture into granules, powders, and other masterbatch vehicles, and the bagging of the final product. Advantages of using masterbatches in plastic manufacturing Masterbatch brings some physical property improvements for the final plastic products: Productivity Masterbatch can increase volumetric output (as a result of thermal conductivity and volumetric expansion to temperature). In addition, it has the ability to downgauge due to higher film physical properties.

But carrying a lot of cash in hand is not at all a wise idea. Also, who would want to carry a lot of cash in hand and make their wallet bulge out. In such situations, plastic money comes for help. Your wallet will remain perfect and your cash needs will also be sorted out. If required you can take cash using plastic cards. Also, it is safe when you have a card with you as even if it is lost, you can always call the bank and ask them to block it. This avoids misusing the card by any.

Plastic money is rapidly becoming one of the most widely used forms of payment platforms. But what is plastic money? There are essentially two different types of cards that can be classified as plastic money \u2013 a debit card and a credit card. In this article we will talk about the different forms of debit cards and the reasons behind it becoming one of the most popular types of plastic money available in the market today. A credit card essentially helps you to take money on credit and you need to pay back the money when the financial institution raises a bill. But in case of the debit card, you are making an immediate payment and hence no terms of credit are involved in it. Before we go into the details as why you should opt for a debit card, we need to understand the basic functions of it. A debit card is linked to the bank account you have with the financial institution or bank. When you are getting a debit card, you are actually getting a pass to use the balance in your account without having to go to the bank each time or signing a cheque each time you make a payment. When you are swiping your debit card, you are essentially taking out money from your bank through that card.

Interest, for non payment: A credit card allows you to purchase today and pay for at a later period of time. It gives you a credit period, but if we fail to make the payment within the due date, interest will be charged. When we are using cash, we are not taking any credit from the bank, hence non-payment does not occur. We are living in a world where almost every other person holds plastic money along with cash. But we should know the advantages and disadvantages of it in order to use the plastic money efficiently. It is true that at times plastic money is of great help but we should admit that it is not the case always. One should be wise when using plastic money or cash.

Onto this article by Mr. Arends. Legally, all types of merchants who accept credit cards, from gas station owners to web designers, have always had the freedom to offer a discount for paying with cash instead of a credit card, thus eliminating the fees associated with accepting credit cards. Most merchants, however, were not in the habit of pursuing this money-saving option because the payment networks used \"restrictions\" to discourage the practice. The Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act(1), which is now law, eliminates those \"restrictions\" and gives retailers true freedom to offer discounts for using cash over a credit card. \"...Plastic is so over. The new cash is, er, cash....\" Consumers like using cards. In my opinion, most people would not be comfortable carrying around wads of cash so as to enjoy discounts offered by retailers and other merchants. Using credit cards is much safer, and convenient.

All cards are subject to what are called interchange or transaction fees. These fees are the \"cost\" of transferring funds between the merchant bank and the customer's bank (card issuer). Companies like Visa determine these fees, which often involve a fixed and variable component. For example, the interchange fee might be $0.25 per transaction plus 2% of the purchase price. Generally, merchants prefer their customers use debit cards. That's because the interchange fees are usually lower than credit cards. The higher interchange fees associated with credit cards allow financial institutions to profitably market offers such as 1% cash back rewards. The \"behind the scenes\" difference between using a credit and a debit card is very straightforward, and knowing how they differ will lead right into a discussion of the pros and cons for each card type.

Originally only about 20,000 people signed up for the Diner\u2019s Club card. However, the portable plastic cards soon gained popularity. American Express released its own charge card in 1958.

The act of handing someone physical bills from your wallet or purse makes you think a lot more about the purchase. It&apos;s important that you actually see the money; when you charge an item, your brain doesn&apos;t internalize the spending and only sees the reward of your purchase.

Visa USA, the nation's largest credit card company, said that card purchases at supermarkets totaled $981 million in the 12-month period ended April 1, well above the $600 million for the previous 12 months. Consumers used Mastercard to ring up $550 million in sales during the first six months of 1992, against only $190 million during the same period last year. The trend is reflected in the food retailing industry. Only 800 supermarkets accepted credit cards issued by Mastercard and Visa for checkout purchases before April, 1991.

Before you start charging ahead, here's a look at some of the best ways to pay for different items on your list this winter: Plastic is especially useful here because pricey (and often prone to defects) consumer electronics have high rates of return. Using a card generates another paper trail in case you lose your receipt, or if a retailer is unwilling to take a return. Also, keep in mind: Fees: When you're making a purchase, ask about restocking fees charged by some stores for giving refunds and whether the seller allows returns on merchandise that's been opened or defective. If you can, get policies in writing. Perks: Card issuers such as Visa and MasterCard may offer extended protection for disputes with merchants. Benefits vary, so call customer service before you start shopping. See whether any of your cards\u0097even retail cards\u0097offer extended repair or installation services.

Of all the choices you make at the checkout counter, the decision to pay with a credit card has the biggest impact on your bottom line. Multiple studies, including this 2008 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, have found consumers are willing to spend more when they pay with a credit card instead of cash. \"Credit cards allow consumers to focus more on what they&apos;re getting, or buying, than what they&apos;re losing, or spending,\" explains Kit Yarrow, a professor of psychology and marketing at Golden Gate University.

A credit card essentially helps you to take money on credit and you need to pay back the money when the financial institution raises a bill. But in case of the debit card, you are making an immediate payment and hence no terms of credit are involved in it.

These materials are often used to make products such as cups, food containers, bags, films, and the like. Virgin polypropylene and polyethylene are difficult to print, emboss, polish and the like to meet industry standards for plastic cards. However, the inventors have found additional processing steps that promote adhesion characteristics of the polymeric material, which will be described in more detail below. Plastic card 100 can comprise one or more suitable \u201cgreen\u201d materials, such as, for example, filled or unfilled polymeric materials including polypropylene, polyethylene, filled polypropylene, filled polyethylene, and/or filled PLA. A filled material is one in which a filler is compounded into the base resin. For example, polypropylene can be made from natural gas rather than oil more readily than PVC and styrene as described above. Therefore, polypropylene made from natural gas would not be subject to the oil price fluctuations.

Top right in the gallery is a charga-plate. These devices were introduced into select Boston department stores in 1928 and continued to play an important role in the US credit market well into the 1950s.[2] The embossed plate would be inserted into an accompanying \u2018imprinter\u2019, which would transfer the customer\u2019s details, via carbon paper, on to the sales draft. These metal plates were thus able to carry individualized information in (effectively) three dimensions \u2013 and, crucially, this information became transferable when inserted into an accompanying technological infrastructure. In this context, the particular problem that the metal used in these cards moved towards solving was a problem of translation. It is these same problems that the plastic credit card itself later solved, initially by being able to host customer details, including a unique signature, and later by the gradual addition of machine readable numerical information, magnetic stripes and, most recently, electronic chips.[3] In part, then, the success of plastic is its malleability: its willingness to hold its shape, to live more or less happily alongside a diverse range of other elements and materials, and to help to gather these together into a neat, robust, whole.

It is a pointless distinction to most consumers, since the price is the same either way. But behind the scenes, billions of dollars are at stake. When you sign a debit card receipt at a large retailer, the store pays your bank an average of 75 cents for every $100 spent, more than twice as much as when you punch in a four-digit code. The difference is so large that Costco will not allow you to sign for your debit purchase in its checkout lines. Wal-Mart and Home Depot steer customers to use a PIN, the debit card norm outside the United States. Despite all this, signature debit cards dominate debit use in this country, accounting for 61 percent of all such transactions, even though PIN debit cards are less expensive and less vulnerable to fraud.

The Visa and MasterCard settlement could have a significant effect on how the costs of processing credit card payments are paid. The antitrust lawsuit was based on the premise, which was only alleged and not proven, that swipe fees were kept artificially high and, incidentally, hidden from consumers. The settling plaintiffs claim that swipe fees will go down and be more visible to consumers. Depending upon how consumers react to the possibility of paying more for a purchase when they use a credit card, or less when they pay cash, the settlement could initiate a reversal in the consumer trend of recent past decades to substitute plastic and electronic payments for cash.

The antitrust lawsuit was based on the premise, which was only alleged and not proven, that swipe fees were kept artificially high and, incidentally, hidden from consumers. The settling plaintiffs claim that swipe fees will go down and be more visible to consumers. Depending upon how consumers react to the possibility of paying more for a purchase when they use a credit card, or less when they pay cash, the settlement could initiate a reversal in the consumer trend of recent past decades to substitute plastic and electronic payments for cash.

This information will be essential in helping you choose the right credit card processing company for your needs. Tiered/Bucket pricing is the outdated pricing structure that gave credit card processing its poor reputation. Tiered pricing allows processors to group payments into different levels, and charge a set fee at each level. Processors aren\u2019t required to state the markup at each level, or how payments are sorted, so business owners have no way of knowing how much profit the processor is making for each swipe. Meaning that for each swipe your business pays interchange (which goes to the issuing bank), plus 0.25% of the total charge and a flat fee of $0.10 (which goes to the processor). Some companies use variations on this model. Payment Depot, for example, charges interchange plus a flat fee of $0.05 to $0.15, but does not take a percentage of each swipe.

I for one, though, don't really mind these under the radar fees for several reasons. 1. Interchange fees power our payment grid. Credit card interchange fees cover the costs of maintaining the invisible network that connects the swipe pad at your favorite stores to the database at your bank. Think of an interchange platform as a series of interstate highways that gets the money from your credit card or checking account into your merchant's cash register. Those credit card merchant fees amount to about 2-3%, depending on the relationship your vendor has with credit card issuers. If you've written a check at a retail store in the last few years, you'll appreciate the time saving value of a reliable, secure payment platform. 2. For rebate cardholders, credit card interchange fees boomerang back. If you enjoy cash back rebate credit cards, frequent flyer mile cards, or other credit card rewards like I do, you're really just getting back a chunk of the interchange fees that you already pay for goods and services when you use plastic at the checkout counter. Personally, I don't mind if other consumers cover the costs of some of the bigger rewards in the industry, like the 5% rebates I get on gasoline using my rebate credit card ! Should I feel bad if consumers that pay by cash or check help subsidize my rewards? I think not. Credit card merchant fees also help"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Paper or plastic? Retailers struggle with fees as customers increasingly use bank cards over cash Retailers say they're the biggest tax you've never heard of: They're transaction fees that credit card companies and banks charge merchants every time a customer swipes a credit or debit card to pay for a purchase. As dozens of lawsuits challenging the fees grind through the courts and Congress holds off on any action, many mom-and-pop merchants are taking matters into their own hands. Violating the terms of their card agreements, many are requiring minimum purchases - typically $10 - for customers using plastic. Rockland-based Tedeschi Food Shops has received at least two complaints in recent weeks about franchisees setting minimum purchases, executive vice president Robert Tedeschi Jr. said. The company has notified them that they are violating Tedeschi's policy. Still, Tedeschi said he sympathizes with the plight of independent merchants, who lose money every time a customer pays for a small transaction with a card. ''We put a notice out to all franchisees that you can't do it,'' Tedeschi said. ''I hate to tell them that, because it's just killing them.'' Tedeschi Food Shops typically would make a profit of 2 cents on a $3 gallon of gas, but transaction fees gobble up 9 cents per gallon, causing shops to oftentimes lose money on gasoline sales, Tedeschi said.

Magnetic stripe cards, e.g., credit cards, debit cards, membership cards, and the like, have long been employed to facilitate commerce and for identification purposes. Generally speaking, a magnetic stripe card includes a plastic or metallic card base on which a magnetic stripe is affixed. The information necessary to conduct a transaction (such as a purchase of goods/services or an identification query) is embedded in the magnetic stripe on the card. Many cards also include visually perceptible or human-readable data embossed or printed directly on the card itself. The data embedded in the magnetic pattern and the visually perceptible data may be used alternatively or together by the cardholder to accomplish a transaction. In this document, credit cards will be employed as examples. However, the problems and solutions discussed herein are not limited to credit cards and may apply to all magnetic stripe cards irrespective of the purpose for which they are employed. Contemporary credit cards, which are representative of magnetic stripe cards, are widely employed to facilitate the purchase of goods and services by cardholders. To facilitate discussion, a description of a typical credit card transaction is provided. Suppose, for example, a cardholder wishes to purchase a book using his credit card. If the purchase is performed in a manner that does not require the physical handling of the card by the merchant or the physical presence of the card (such as an online purchase), the cardholder may provide the credit card information (e.g., credit card number, expiration date, security code, cardholder's"}, {"title": "rpj_c4", "text": "separate magnetic stripes allow staging of payments for cashflow because payment periods can be staggered, allowing more frequent smaller payments, rather than a single large payment. Another advantage is the ability to assign specific types of payment to specific lines of credit. For example, charging emergency uses, such as healthcare expenses, to one of the magnetic stripes and personal uses to the other magnetic stripe. These are merely exemplary of advantages that the credit card, according to the present invention, provides to the credit card user. With respect to credit card banks, credit card banks which distribute transaction cards, such as the cards 20 and 40, have the advantage of garnering additional market share by replacing at least one other transaction card in the user's array to thereby become a card of choice. In addition, business/personal card synergies are achievable, benefitting both users and credit card banks. For example, a strong corporate card can add all of its business customers to its personal card portfolio by providing a combination business/personal card (and vice-versa). Such an advantage is even more compelling when card rebates, such as airline miles, are consolidated for both accounts on a card. Deployment of credit cards, such as the credit cards 20 and 40, is relatively easy to implement because the cards themselves are relatively inexpensive to produce since it is less expensive to manufacture single credit cards with dual stripes than to manufacture two separate one-stripe cards.

Other types of companies liked that baked-in loyalty as well, creating their own credit card variations and adding new features along the way. Transportation companies also got in the act. Early gas stations in the 1920s started offering cards of their own, taking advantage of the fact that travelers and commuters need to keep fueling up. Companies like Texaco, in producing their cards, decided upon a slightly better format than the department store dog tags: playing-card-sized pieces of paper. That helped to set a standard size for payment cards. The airline industry proved to be a major innovator in the credit realm. In 1936, American Airlines started issuing the Air Travel Card,which is generally considered the first \u201ccharge card\u201d in history. Over time, it added two key innovations to the credit card model: upon its launch, it utilized a numbering system that tied a specific user to a specific number.

Interest is charged based on the terms of the credit card agreement and the holder is sometimes charged an annual fee. Traditionally, a plastic card bearing an account number is assigned to the holder. Credit card transactions utilize proprietary networks that are paid for by the merchants to settle transactions.

With credit cards ubiquitous, it\u2019s hard to fathom that the first widespread use of credit cards in North America started only about half a century ago with the introduction of the closed-loop Diners Club Card. The now-infamous story of Frank McNamara\u2019s restaurant faux pas of forgetting to bring cash spurred the idea of a general purpose card for travel and entertainment purchases on credit. Since their introduction in the late 1960s, credit cards exploded onto the scene and took consumer spending with them. American Express helped kick off the expansion with its version of the travel and entertainment charge card in 1958, and many other financial institutions followed suit. The average consumer in the United States now has 5.4 cards in his or her wallet and contributes voraciously to the roughly $4 trillion spent domestically and $8 trillion spent globally on credit and debit cards annually.2 Much to the gratification of banks and other issuers, credit and debit cards became their most stable and profitable product in a robust portfolio of consumer and corporate offerings. The boom and proliferation fueled by consumer appetite and increasing competition spawned more nuanced offerings, with credit cards being packaged finely to the varying tastes of the customer.

Even at a high-interest rate, taking out this kind of loan can make a lot of sense for a consumer and isn\u2019t necessarily irresponsible.

During the workshop, Martien presented evidence of improved supply and demand conditions for small business credit cards.

The issuing authority, in effect, assures the individual that it will lend him a certain amount of money (equal to the card limit) to pay for his purchases. All credit cards follow a standard size called ID-1, as defined under ISO/IEC 7810, which is 85.60 x 53.98 mm. A credit card is very different from a debit card, because in such a transaction, money is not taken out of the cardholder's bank account. It is simply reduced from the total amount that can be lent by the bank (which is the credit limit). Interest is charged on the total amount spent by the cardholder as per a 'revolving credit' method. The individual can then choose to either repay the entire amount due or pay a minimum amount, every billing cycle. The terms and conditions, including the method of calculating the minimum amount due and the rate of interest, the amount of days after which the interest will be charged, etc. are mentioned in the contract or agreement between the individual and the card issuer.

This is because most people typically only see their personal bank accounts and billing statements (e.g., from a utility). A depositor's bank account is actually a Liability to the bank, because the bank legally owes the money to the depositor. Thus, when the customer makes a deposit, the bank credits the account (increases the bank's liability). At the same time, the bank adds the money to its own cash holdings account. Since this account is an Asset, the increase is a debit. But the customer typically does not see this side of the transaction. On the other hand, when a utility customer pays a bill or the utility corrects an overcharge, the customer's account is credited. This is because the customer's account is one of the utility's accounts receivable, which are Assets to the utility because they represent money the utility can expect to receive from the customer in the future. Credits actually decrease Assets (the utility is now owed less money). If the credit is due to a bill payment, then the utility will add the money to its own cash account, which is a debit because the account is another Asset.

Make sure you take this initial step so that when charges start appearing from Chile, the credit card company doesn\u2019t think they are fraudulent. \u201cRed Compra\u201d loosely translates to \u201cBuyer\u2019s Network.\u201d Even though the sign does use the color red, that isn\u2019t what it is referring to. Don\u2019t assume that you\u2019ll be able to use your credit card everywhere. Many places, particularly smaller stores and vendors, only take cash. Carry credit card alternatives, principally Chilean pesos or your ATM card to access pesos. When paying for a purchase, the cashier may ask you \u201c\u00bfcu\u00e1ntas cuotas?\u201d They want to know how many payments/installments you want your charge split into. You should say \u201cuna sola\u201d (just one) or \u201csin cuotas\u201d (no installments). Many Chileans use their debit cards for purchases. This means they swipe their card and then enter their PIN number. Since you\u2019ll be using a credit card, this may confuse the cashier who is used to debit cards. So be patient if they have to swipe your card a few times.

With Square, anyone can accept credit or debit card payments by downloading the app and plugging a little plastic cube into the headphone jack of an iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or Android phone. After a quick swipe of the card through the reader, the merchant turns the device over to the customer to sign his or her name on the touchscreen using a finger instead of a pen. The customer can add a tip, either by percentage or a particular amount, and then enters their phone number or email address. In the best case, the receipt message will buzz in the customer\u2019s pocket as an email or SMS text message while walking away with their purchase.

Users must also take a smartphone photo of the cards they load onto Coin. This information is stored on a user\u2019s Coin card account. Coin can store an unlimited number of cards but only eight can be active on the actual device at once. Choosing which cards are active on Coin can be done from a browser or mobile app. A small readout on the Coin device can display brief details about any card that a user chooses for a payment. So, if you\u2019re using an American Express card, the display will show AMEX. The display can also show the last four numbers of a card and its expiration date.

So, what does the data tell us? Is it just a matter of time before we are all using mobile wallets? Is mobile wallet technology really making our lives better and our payments more secure? Is it living up to the promise of killing off cash and plastic? The percentage of people trying mobile wallets has plateaued, and Apple Pay is in slight decline. The actual usage of mobile wallets is very low\u2014less than 4.5%\u2014and growth has flatlined. Security concerns were cited by about a quarter of those surveyed across all payment platforms. Nearly half of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their current payment methods. Most respondents rated Apple Pay the same as or worse than swiping a credit card for ease of use (69%), speed (64%), security (67%) and convenience (59%). The overwhelming message from the results is that mobile wallet solutions are not offering a compelling value proposition. In other words, they just aren\u2019t different enough from tapping or swiping a credit card.

Mobile fuel payments are more secure than the physical card swipe because, with mobile, there\u2019s no physical contact between the card and the fueling terminal.

Typical macroscopic swipe cards, like credit cards or hotel room cards, often encode the information magnetically. The specific swipe card model of odorant recognition we assess here uses a molecular vibration frequency as the additional information. The theory of Turin proposes that an electron transfer occurs if the odorant has the right vibrational frequency: discrimination and activation are achieved by an inelastic electron tunnelling (IET) mechanism, dependent on the ability of the odorant to absorb the correct amount of energy. IET describes a phenomenon well known in inorganic systems. The swipe card description was conceived as a generalisation of models like Turin's original idea of conventional IET within a biological context, but we emphasise that there are important differences. In our own work [20] we made a critical assessment of Turin's basic ideas, showed that the ideas seemed robust, needing values of key parameters in line with those from other biological studies. Our present paper extends the analysis, generalizing the simpler model of the previous paper, and assessing possible physical realizations. In our earlier publication, we could find no physics-based objections to Turin's model of the signal transduction mechanism in odorant recognition, in which discrimination and activation are achieved by IET. An advantage of such models is that they are potentially predictive. IET in inorganic systems is usually observed in circumstances that allow transmission over a continuum of energies.

Then the onPreLoad() event returns information on the cards queued behind the current card. After all the cards have been drawn, the user may control the cards by dragging. While dragging, the onDragging() event tracks the direction and magnitude of the drag. Finally, in the case the user does not drag the card and merely ceases to control the card to cancel said card, the onCanceled() event triggers. In the other case where the user follows through with a swipe, the onSwiped() event returns information about the swiped card. At this point, the card is considered consumed and the process repeats with the next card in the queue. The lifecycle of a card is a natural abstraction for our purposes. First, it allows us to easily track and categorize user activity. For instance, it could be the case that specific demographics spend more time at some point in the UI. Lifecycles provide a convenient framework both for collection and for making sense of this data. Furthermore, lifecycles are well-suited for applying animations to radar charts. When a card is shown in the top view, the associated radar chart may be animated. But when a card is being shown in the next view as the previous card is being dragged, the card in the next view must not be animated as it may be distracting to the user whose focus should be on the top view.

Rootkits exploit the process called modification \u2014 when a user changes account permissions and security. Usually this process is only allowed by a computer administrator. In computing this type of modification helps to make some positive and needed changes to systems while threat actors take advantage of this in their own pursuit. But before they can install a rootkit threat actors need to obtain administrator or root access. To do so they often exploit known vulnerabilities such as obtaining private passwords via phishing or privilege escalation. Sometimes the process can be automated. IMPORTANT NEWS FOR THE READER: The main threats that Gridinsoft Anti-Malware detects are something that is important to know. Popular Rootkit Attack Examples The malware4 presents danger to anything that uses an operating system. In addition to the deep rooted nature the malware can also disable or remove the security software. But some rootkits are used for purely legitimate reasons. For example IT specialists use it for remote IT support or assist law enforcement. It\u2019s more often that the rootkit is used for malicious purposes by the threat actors to manipulate a computer\u2019s operating system and provide remote users with admin access. The attackers usually install rootkits in the following ways: Infecting credit card swipes or scanners. Back in the day cybercriminals have used rootkits to infect scanners and credit card swipes.

Perhaps because it sort of violates the social contract? When New Yorkers move to the Bay Area, they\u2019re often accused of personality crimes. Being haughty, cagey, and ragey-for-no-reason are just a few. I know this because I was one of them, and when I lived in Berkeley, there was one experience that drew out all of the stereotypes I had in me: Riding on Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART. Twitter data scientist Asif Haque has had his BART frustrations, too. Thus, he decided to take a data-driven approach to see if its fares were \u201cfair\u201d or not. In the process, he also devised a system to help riders artificially lower the cost of riding on public transportation by switching cards with fellow passengers in mid-ride. For those unfamiliar, BART\u2019s swiping and pricing system works like this: A passenger puts money on a paper ticket or plastic Clipper card, swipes through a turnstile at the origin stop, then swipes through another turnstile at the destination. How much you\u2019re charged depends on where you eventually exit, and not necessarily how many stops you travel. (It\u2019s a mileage-based formula, plus certain taxes here and there.)

What's really amazing is the card. You get a plastic card that you load with money -- you tap it against a terminal to get in, and tap again to get out. So much better than swipe or insert ticket -- pretty small detail, but made everything just that much easier & faster. Now, the really nice thing about this card is the integration of this card with the rest of Taiwan. You can use it at any 7-11/corner store (these are everywhere -- often multiple on a single block). It's also getting integrated into apartments. Meaning your subway card can get you around town, buy food, and open your house door. So awesome. ![mrtcard](/images/taipei-mrt-easy-card.JPG) Overall, getting around in Taiwan is just easy. And you only need a single card to leave the house. Bonus -- Taiwan also has a bunch of public bike racks around town that you can check out and ride around. It's free for the first 30 minutes, and there's a corresponding app that tells you where they are, where you can park, etc. And to check a bike out, you just need to use your subway card. ![taiwanbike](/images/taiwan-bike.jpg) **Self Serve Culture** Outside of transportation, one of the major differences that I noticed between Taiwan and America was an inherent culture of self serve.

From Table 3, we observe that MISSA maintains longer conversations (14.9 turns) compared with Transfer-Transfo (8.5 turns), which means MISSA is better at maintaining the attacker's engagement. MISSA also has a higher task success score (1.294) than TransferTransfo (1.025), which indicates that it elicits information more strategically. In the top two dialogs (A and B) that are shown in Table 4, both attackers were eliciting a credit card number in their first turns. TransferTransfo directly gave away the informa- tion, while MISSA replied with a semantically-related question \"why would you need my credit card number?\" Furthermore, in the next turn, TransferTransfo ignored the context and asked an irrelevant question \"what is your name?\" while MISSA was able to generate the response \"why can't you use my address?\", which is consistent to the context.

As shown in the bottom two dialogs in Table 4, attackers in both dialogs introduced their names in their first utterances. MISSA recognized attacker's name, while the hybrid model did not.

Of course, it would also be appreciated if you can tell me a better expression. A: The following are the two common forms of the the idiom: * *To crack the nut: Example: We have tried to crack the nut many times, but still have not found a design that consumers approve. *A hard nut to crack: Example: Fixing our relationship with the marketing department has been a hard nut crack. (To crack this hard nut is not specifically a form that is generally familiar.) A similar idiom is a thorn in the side (the article before side may be substituted for a possessive pronoun). It generally means a problem that has created difficulties over a long period of time, often a conflict with other individuals or groups. For example, the oil lobby has long been the thorn in the side of the clean-air movement, or my injury from training has been a thorn in my side all season. Finally, in regular speech, someone may say simply, \"That's a tough one\", which means essentially the problem you just explained is difficult to solve, or the question you just asked is difficult to answer in a helpful way. For example, \"Can I buy food somewhere nearby?\", \"That's a tough one; most stores closed for the night\".

While not a universal characteristic of hip-hop/rap music, it is extremely common. Note that there are situations where the word is used and can be elided without hurting the voice or meaning. We all know the acceptable version of Kanye's Gold Digger: \"But she ain't messin' with no broke, broke\". In this case the song can be 'sanitized' for popular consumption without hurting the voice or meaning of the song. There is, however, at least a sub-genre where the voice of the speaker relies on the heavy use of that appropriated word. So if I want to Break Ma Neck, what am I to do? I can sing the Misfits in front of a crowd at the Highball but not Master P or Ol Dirty Bastard? It seems so. In the case of this word, it is clear to me that meaning is tied up not only with the historical and sociological factors of its use and appropriation, but also the 'difference' between speakers.

However, in some works from this period Rabboni is used as a name for God. Thus some scholars, such as Hoskyns, see the term as demonstrating that Mary has understood Jesus' divinity. Most scholars consider the title a respectful one, but less adoring than the term adonai. By contrast, when Thomas later accepts the truth of the resurrection he calls Jesus \"My lord and my God\" (John 20:28). Mary's reaction seems to be spontaneous, and it is not known if \"Rabboni\" is an exclamation of discovery, or whether it should read \"Rabboni?\" with Mary momentarily questioning Jesus. The Greek word \u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 in the original text and its Latin translation magister mean \"teacher\". Older English translations use \"master\", derived from the Latin word and meaning the same thing. Context Mary has found Jesus' tomb empty and is worrying about what happened to his body. At first she does not recognize Jesus when he appears, thinking he is a gardener. In John 20:16 she recognizes him when he calls her by name. John 20:14 has already mentioned that Mary had turned around to see Jesus, so why does this verse say she turns again? One school of thought is that unmentioned by the author Mary had turned away from Jesus in the meantime. Kastner argues that she did so because the resurrected Jesus was nude.

In fact, we cannot help but believe her. This is the opposite of nonsense. But poetry as such-as the enemy of meaning, in the usual sense of meaning-has to be acknowledged to be pure nonsense. This is not because poetry doesn't mean anything; it is because poetry does not allow language to be subordinated. Meaning is the corpse of language; it is what has been left behind after language has been destroyed, liquidated, discarded.

Rav Na\u1e25man said that Rav said that she prophesied when she was only Aaron\u2019s sister, before Moses was born, saying that her mother was destined to bear a son who would deliver the Jewish people to salvation. When Moses was born, the entire house was filled with light, and her father stood and kissed her on the head and told her that her prophecy had been fulfilled. But when Moses was cast into the river, her father patted her on the head, asking what had become of her prophecy, as it looked as though Moses would soon meet his"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "can improve men with his beauty, and Kritoboulos responds that he is not worth much if he cannot (3.7). Antisthenes is proud of his wealth although we learn from Hermogenes' question that Antisthenes actually has little money or land, which fact he jokes about (3.8). His answer seems paradoxical. Charmides, on the other hand, prides himself on his poverty. Socrates praises this notion, because poverty does not cause envy, it is safe without being guarded, and it grows when neglected (3.9). Next Kallias asks Socrates on what he prides himself. His answer, like his comments in sections2.16-2.19, is in jest (Huss reference). He says that he prides himself on match-making. Everyone laughs at his boast, and Socrates continues his jest saying that he could make a lot of money through the trade (3.10). This funny exchange leads Lykon to say that Philippos' pride must lie in jesting. When asked by Antisthenes, Lykon says that he is most proud of his son, Autolykos. At this someone remarked that the boy was obviously proud of his victory in the pankration, but Autolykos denies this claiming instead to be most proud of his father (3.13). Kallias then addressed Lykon saying that he was the richest man in the world, a fact which Lykon admits. Finally Hermogenes says that he exalts most in the virtue and power of his friends because they can take care of him (3.14).

The Deluxe Version of the album contains a DVD with interviews with Toby about the songs on the record, the making of this record and an inside look at the Diverse City Band. The album debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, selling 79,000 units in its first week. As of early November 2010, the album has sold over 315,000 copies. Recording When asked about the album by stereotruth.net Toby had the following to say about the emotions that went into producing it; \"The recording process means a lot to me, and I don't approach what I do haphazardly. I have a lot of passion when it comes to my records. I don't know if it's good or bad, but there's this range of emotions that come with making a record. Music is something that can actually open people\u2019s minds to who God is. Music will never change the world, but God can choose to use music, and that's what I count on. I want my songs to be said in a way that anyone can relate to them. I want them to move people's lives forward; move people toward God, and if I'm accomplishing that, whether or not anyone loves this record, as long as I feel like that is what I\u2019m doing, then I feel like my job is done.\" Singles \"City"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Then we tied it in with a song we already had about a girl who was so fit and she knew it and we renamed it 'You Said No.'\" Critical reception In a review for the song, Music Week stated: \"Self-deprecating and completely infectious, this will be all over the radio\", while Scotland's Daily Record made it Single of the Week. UKMIX was less enthusiastic, regarding the song as \"nowhere near as interesting as \"Year 3000\" or \"What I Go to School For\", but pretty amusing when you think about the bad lyrics\". Chart performance On 27 April 2003, \"You Said No\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, marking Busted's first number one at the third attempt. Additionally, with previous singles \"What I Go to School For\" and \"Year 3000\" having peaked at number three and number two, respectively, Busted became the first act ever to have their first three singles enter the top three in ascending order, a feat that got them into Guinness World Records. Music video In the video for the song, Busted try to impress some girls by doing bike stunts at a rally, before being bettered by more experienced riders. Despite this, the video suggests that the singers find someone afterwards: an attractive nurse, played by Lucy Finnigan.

What's going on? `slice()` returns a copy of an array. This is awesome! But there's this weird line in the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) docs that says slice 'returns a shallow copy'. The [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/tkcsy6fe(v=vs.94).aspx) and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_array.asp) docs don't mention this at all, so what in the world does this mean? Let's think back for a moment to [how variables work](http://prestonparry.com/articles/VariableNamesAsLinks/). They're basically just links to some other place on the hard drive where the actual data is stored. ##What hapens if there are variables in my array? What slice does is copy over the variable, not the data that variable points to. Say you make a change to the object a variable is pointing to. The 'copied' array will still include a variable pointing to that same object, which has now been changed. **Slice copies over variables as pointers, and does not create a copy of the data each variable points to.** ##How to create a 'deep' copy Creating a 'deep' copy means your new copy will have no linkages to the original object. The easiest to create a deep copy by far is to use JSON. {% highlight css linenos=table %} var mySuperNestedArr = [myFavoriteSuperHeroesArr,myFavoriteCatGifsObj,taySwiftsEntireCatalogueObj]; var completelySeparateCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mySuperNestedArr)); {% endhighlight %} When you JSON.stringify a variable, it creates a whole new object.

Every time a set of changes is commited, it is logged and a version of the repository is saved.

If it detects jQuery 3.0 or newer it warns and does nothing. **Requires jQuery 1.8+** ## What is `requestAnimationFrame`? `requestAnimationFrame` is a [W3C spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/#requestAnimationFrame) (at [Candidate Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#q74) level) that attempts to improve our animation performace by better syncing up with the frame rate of the browser.

To quote part of the Jank Busting article: > * Animations in background tabs get paused, conserving system resources and battery life. > > * If the system can't handle rendering at the screen's refresh rate, it can throttle animations and produce the callback less frequently (say, 30 times a second on a 60Hz screen). While this drops framerate in half, it keeps the animation consistent -- and as stated above, our eyes are much more attuned to variance than framerate. A steady 30Hz looks better than 60Hz that misses a few frames a second. ## Download Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max] of version 0.1.2.

The notion of accepting medical recommendations out of fear introduces the issue of power. Describing a patient-provider interaction as charged with fear acknowledges the provider's power to shape how a patient feels. A different patient expanded on this dynamic: If you look at someone who is the health worker and is putting on that uniform it adds some grain of believability unlike someone that is from the community where we live.

Leung's early childhood was punctuated with parents' quarrels and arguments about money. A mischievous boy in his early years, Leung's personality changed when his father, a chronic gambler, left the family when he was eight; he and his younger sister were brought up by their mother. Leung was a slightly reticent, quiet child. He has said that his childhood experiences paved the way for his acting career, which allows him to openly express his feelings:You don't know what happened, just one day your pop disappears. And from that day on I try not to communicate with anyone. I'm so afraid to talk to my classmates, afraid that if someone says something about family I won't know what to do. So I became very isolated. So that's why I love acting, because I can express all my feelings the way I couldn't for so long. I'm a quiet person. And then when I went to TV it all came out; I cried and I wasn't ashamed.

Next time you log into your system, it will ask you to plug your yubikey, so that the system and the *Yubikey* can communicate.

I think it just evolved and by the 60's it was associated to cutting frames Perhaps the term chopper came about from the saying \"chop and change\" in the earliest days, and then the association to neck cutting was just a coincidence and was then adopted as the style. I too am fascinated by this history.

The simplest chords are triads, which are made of the first note of a scale and then alternate notes. For example, in the scale of C Major (C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C), the triad would be C,E,G. Seventh chords use four notes: they consist of a triad with an added interval. For example, in the scale of G Dominant (G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G), the four-note seventh chord would be G,B,D,F. There are also more complicated chords which add additional intervals (see ninth chord, \"alt dom\"). A chord can also be played one note at a time (see \"arpeggio\" and \"broken chord\"). chorus: the refrain of a song which is repeated a number of times, in alternation with verses and other sections (e.g., a guitar solo). In contrast to the verses of a song, the chorus tends to be simpler and more memorable, and it often uses more repetition of lyrics (e.g., \"She loves me yeah, yeah, yeah...\"). The term \"chorus\" may also be a synonym for \"choir\"--a group of singers; or it may refer to a chorus effect--the sound created when a voice or instrumental tone is doubled by other pitches which are not exactly the same, which creates a rich, shimmering sound. chromatic scale: a"}, {"title": "rpj_common_crawl_2021_04", "text": "side of you, this sentence makes perfect sense.

What happens when you break them apart and the results are uneven, one top bigger than the other? According to Chinese legend, this foretells: 1) A death in the family 2) Someone just got pregnant 3) A rocky road in your love life 4) A change in jobs 5) Just some splinters The answer is #3, a rocky road in your love life. When the break is uneven, it represents an uneven relationship, which we all know is unhealthy and headed for trouble.

I mentioned the term to my 91 year-old father. Yes, it was once widely used; and yes, it meant in no time at all. I have vague memories as a very young kind of waving around a wilted flower stem, or perhaps a stick of rhubarb, and pretending I was doing a couple of shakes of a dead lamb's dangly bit. Though I recall finding the phrase distinctly macabre Looking at the web, it seems there are all sorts of variations, two or three shakes, and with the lamb not necessarily deceased. And from this comes the much more widely used 'two shakes' - as in \"I'll be with you in two shakes\". Where did it come from? Well, the online dictionaries variously suggest an American or Antipodean origin - though one points to an earlier Yorkshire (that's where I grew up) or Welsh origin.

This phrase is still around today, but you may hear someone's mom say it. What does, \"You go, girl!\" mean? You're crazy. You have to leave now. You're really stupid. Congrats! Good job! \"You go, girl\" these days may be used with more of a sense of irony -- or by someone older. But back in the day, it was a way to celebrate successes, big or small.

I understand that putting on the altar is different in that you trade something for something else, that is, you loose the item put for sure. But what about the on the block and on the line? How different they are: syntactic purely or they have semantic differences as well? A: When used in the context you're talking about, \"on the block\" would always be phrased as \"on the chopping block\". If you said \"They're discussing layoffs. My job is on the block\" I would have to stop and think about what you meant, but if you said \"My job is on the chopping block\" I would immediately get the meaning -- your job is one that may be considered for layoffs. The difference between \"on the chopping block\" and \"on the line\" is a question of control. The things put on the chopping block have no say in it. Management discussing layoffs to save money is a situation out of your control, putting your job on the chopping block. If I'm supporting your proposal, knowing that if it fails we're both fired, then I'm putting my job on the line by supporting you.

It also signifies a person with a disorderly or irregular life. In Argentina, pendejo (or pendeja for females) is a pejorative way of saying pibe. The word, in Chile, Colombia, and El Salvador, can refer to a cocaine dealer, or it can refer to a \"fool\". In Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, it has different meanings depending on the situation. It can range from \u00a1Te cogieron de pendejo! (\"You were swindled!\") to \u00a1Qu\u00e9 tipa pendeja! (\"What a dumbass!\" as when a strange woman behaves offensively and then suddenly leaves). In Mexico and some countries in Central America, especially El Salvador, una pendejada/pendeja is used to describe something incredibly stupid that someone has done.

A sings loudly and annoyingly while people are trying to study. B\u2192A: Shut the fuck up down there! Meaning: I really want you, who is down there, to shut up, because your noise bothers me a lot.

The meta-talk that unfolded after Mother-in-law's comment depicted my dialect use as unexpected and positioned me as a dialect novice in comparison to the expert status assumed by Husband and Father-in-law. Examination of the meta-talk excerpt reveals four factors that contribute to the co-construction of me as someone not expected to use dialect: (1) Mother-in-law comments explicitly on my dialect use, (2) she labels the words I used as \"our language\" (this side/her side, i.e., not my side, not my language), (3) I ratify her claim by saying \"busted,\" and (4) Father-inlaw and Husband engage in an account-taking of my knowledge and use of dialect in an extended meta-talk sequence. What is at issue here is how utterances come to be heard or not heard. Meta-talk has the effect of ignoring the content of the utterance and focusing on its linguistic form (cf. Liddicoat 2016). As a result, the utterance fails to be heard, denying the speaker's legitimacy (cf. Bourdieu 1991). In the above example, both Husband's announcement of upcoming plans and my comment about the announcement were lost in the meta-talk discussion. Meta-talk allows L1 speakers to exert their ownership of the language (in this case, of the dialect), making them qualified to comment on the linguistic form of an L2 speaker's utterance.

In other statements, though, he implies or even claims that he does have knowledge. For example, in Plato's Apology Socrates says: \"...but that to do injustice and disobey my superior, god or man, this I know to be evil and base...\" (Apology, 29b6\u20137). In his debate with Callicles, he says: \"...I know well that if you will agree with me on those things which my soul believes, those things will be the very truth...\" Whether Socrates genuinely thought he lacked knowledge or merely feigned a belief in his own ignorance remains a matter of debate. A common interpretation is that he was indeed feigning modesty. According to Norman Gulley, Socrates did this to entice his interlocutors to speak with him. On the other hand, Terence Irwin claims that Socrates's words should be taken literally. Gregory Vlastos argues that there is enough evidence to refute both claims. On his view, for Socrates, there are two separate meanings of \"knowledge\": Knowledge-C and Knowledge-E (C stands for \"certain\", and E stands for elenchus, i.e. the Socratic method). Knowledge-C is something unquestionable whereas Knowledge-E is the knowledge derived from Socrates's elenchus. Thus, Socrates speaks the truth when he says he knows-C something, and he is also truthful when saying he knows-E, for example that it is evil for someone to disobey his superiors, as he claims in Apology.

Symmetrically, we could say feeling loving, but we don't say this because to say loving is enough. 29 The same is valid for other elements of this group, e.g. admiring a person versus the person being admired, even though here the intention of acting upon the admired person seems less obvious than in the case of love.

If you are the second person to blame someone for some serious wrongdoing, it does not mean that your act of blame is less appropriate than the act of blame performed by the first person to blame. So, more precisely, the appropriateness of an act of blame depends (in part) on whether the contributions of others to the amount of blame P deserves would render your added act of blame to be one that contributes to blame beyond P. 20 An observation that an anonymous reviewer helpfully raises pertains to the much maligned lex talionis penal principle, famously associated with the phrase \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\" This principle, at"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "(its), nia (our). These agree with their noun like any other adjective: ni salutis liajn amikojn (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the possessive pronouns; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: la mia (mine). The reflexive pronoun is used in non-subject phrases only to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons: li lavis sin \"he washed (himself)\" ili lavis sin \"they washed themselves (or each other)\" li lavis lin \"he washed him (someone else)\" li man\u011dis sian panon \"he ate his (own) bread\" li man\u011dis lian panon \"he ate his (someone else's) bread\" The indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have a passive verb, oni diras, ke ... \"one says that...\", \"they say that ...\" or \"it is said that ...\" With impersonal verbs, no pronoun is used: pluvas \"it is raining\". Here the rain is falling by itself, and that idea is conveyed by the verb, so no subject pronoun is needed. When not referring to humans, \u011di is mostly used with items that have physical bodies, with tiu or tio used otherwise. Zamenhof proposed that \u011di could also be used as an epicene (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender.

It means simply that it is just the same there as it is here when it is 5 o'clock.\" \u2014 The explanation by means of identity does not work here. Thus, according to Wittgenstein, mental states are intimately connected to a subject's environment, especially their linguistic environment, and conceivability or imaginability.

An example Wittgenstein uses is the \"duckrabbit\", an ambiguous image that can be seen as either a duck or a rabbit. When one looks at the duck-rabbit and sees a rabbit, one is not interpreting the picture as a rabbit, but rather reporting what one sees. One just sees the picture as a rabbit.

The first rule means you shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something. This applies to both technical things (\"What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!\") and non-technical things (\"You don't know who RMS is?!\"). Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit: When people feign surprise, it's usually to make them feel better about themselves and others feel worse. And even when that's not the intention, it's almost always the effect. ### No well-actually's A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, \"well, actually\u2026\" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation. This doesn't mean we aren't about truth-seeking or that we don't care about being precise.

Alternatively, the theory of practopoiesis suggests that the global workspace is achieved in the brain primarily through fast adaptive mechanisms of nerve cells. According to that theory, connectivity does not matter much. Critical is rather the fact that neurons can rapidly adapt to the sensory context within which they operate. Notably, for achieving a global workspace, the theory presumes that these fast adaptive mechanisms have the capability to learn when and how to adapt.

Given the lack of studies which account for the residents' perspectives on resilience to boom and bust cycles, our study is a narrative enquiry of what the resident adult population have to say about their boom and bust experiences within individual, communal, and social contexts. Therefore, in order to answer our main question which is what capacities the adults of this small town have to deal with the multiple challenges they face, our interview questions targeted their individual, social, and work life. The participants' answers were explored for potential promotive and protective processes of resilience with the goal to provide a new understanding of resilience in economically adverse contexts which benefits from the residents' narratives and narrative identity as organizing concepts for the data.

The recent interest in the study of narratives beyond the fictional/ semi-fictional and literary domain has initiated the narrative turn not only in the humanities but within fields as diverse as sociology, medical science, and law.

To raise awareness about microaggressions, facilitators opened with common microaggressions that they have personally experienced in an academic context.

In a nutshell, because some actions may be seen as unacceptably paternalistic in virtue of the fact that they neglect what matters to someone, we should accept a No-Rejection requirement on well-being, which precisely says that what matters to someone is good for this person. Before going further, let me be clear about the status of the two last constraints that I have put forward. My point is not to argue directly that we must accept a certain theory of well-being because some forms of paternalism are wrong. My point is merely to argue that a subjectivist theory of well-being should allow for the rejection of certain actions as wrong and paternalistic because they do not take into account what matters to people. In other words, all things being equal, we should discard subjectivist theories of well-being that would be rejected by anti-paternalists on the grounds that these theories do not tie tightly enough what is good for someone to what matters to him or her. And I argue that the two constraints considered above should be accepted precisely as expressing this theoretical orientation.

Yes, I'm afraid that it does, that it does play a role beneath the surface, but that we do not talk about it.

Consider the oddness of this exchange: \"Q: Why did you have sex with him? A: Because he consented!\" As Wall rightly acknowledges, the act of consent is only permissive or empowering. Consent is a 'cancelling permission', not a defeating reason, in that it does not provide the reasons in favour of performing an action; it only releases one to act on certain reasons in favour of that action, sometimes in spite of the extant reasons against it. 38 'Just because a person consents to penetrative sex', Wall writes, 'does not mean that there is a reason to engage in penetrative sex with that person.' 39 That is quite right, and it underscores a more general point about the relevance of consent for justified wrongdoing. Consent itself is not what provides the justificatory grist when it empowers one to do what would otherwise be wrong. This is sharply brought out by the myriad circumstances in which consent abjectly fails to justify harmful conduct. The power of my consent cannot justify someone in lopping off my arm for fun.

The costless reneging argument The equal participation ideal includes the idea of cooperation for overall advantage. Cooperation for overall advantage requires division of labour and specialisation. For example, I could try to build a house all by myself in the woods, chopping down the trees myself, sawing the logs, and so on. But in an advanced economy, I can draw on division of labour and specialisation and thereby have a better house built more effectively. However, specialisation also creates dependencies. Whereas before my house just depended on my doing my job, now I depend on the contractors and producers doing theirs. In this sense, cooperation for overall advantage parcels out responsibilities and creates dependencies. Equal participants in a cooperative undertaking for overall advantage will join more specific cooperative undertakings. In so doing, participants typically agree to take on obligations towards others. Acquired obligations and dependencies in cooperative undertakings matter for relational egalitarianism. When someone engages in what I call costless reneging, she acquires obligations to other participants, makes no serious effort to discharge them, yet bears no consequential responsibility. For example, imagine my neighbour promises to saw the logs for me if I do her gardening for a week first. Yet after I have done the gardening, she reneges on her obligation and stops speaking to me.

In my opinion, such a question lies at the root of consciousness much more than the complexity problem discussed by others (see below). This is because, for the case of \"time, \" significance attribution cannot be circumvented: the normal work of the scientist becomes impossible if he/she rejects the attribution of \"past\" significance to the retrieved content of a biological or a technical memory. Nevertheless, quite generally, significance attribution is not a valid relationship in the realm of natural science. However, when the task is to elucidate the status of consciousness that attribution would contaminate the investigations. A loss of \"scientific comfort\" is the consequence; the scientist's work becomes more wearisome: The concept of \"time\" can no longer be applied in equal measure to neuronal and to phenomenal events, and one cannot invoke causality, as it is usually done when intracerebral processes are studied.

For example, it is incorrect to say that since the heritability of personality traits is about 0.6, that means that 60% of your personality is inherited from your parents and 40% comes from the environment. In addition, heritability can change without any genetic change occurring, such as when the environment starts contributing to more variation. As a case in point, consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence. Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases, causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation, like showing different levels of intelligence. On the other hand, heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases, causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation, like showing more similar levels of intelligence. Heritability increases when genetics are contributing more variation or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation; what matters is the relative contribution. Heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment. High heritability of a trait, consequently, does not necessarily mean that the trait is not very susceptible to environmental influences. Heritability can also change as a result of changes in the environment, migration, inbreeding, or the way in which heritability itself is measured in the population under study.

This effect makes satellite communication possible and signals of satellite based navigation systems can be received on Earth. Due to the ionosphere, radio waves emitted from satellites are slowed down, deviated from their linear propagation and scattered by plasma inhomogeneities. In global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), this relative time delay equals distance errors up to 100 m. Because of plasma turbulences induced by space weather, signals are scattered. This leads to strong fluctuations in signal strength, the so called radio scintillations. Strong scintillations usually only occur in high and equatorial latitudes. Nevertheless, even in Central Europe ionospheric perturbations can affect the precision and reliability of GNSS applications and reduce its economic efficiency. This is an important reason why the examination of the ionosphere is a research field at the DLR Neustrelitz.

Ionospheric effects: The ionosphere is the ionised layer of the Earth atmosphere located from around 60 kilometres to several thousand kilometres. When propagation through the ionosphere, navigation signals are disturbed, resulting in range measurement errors or reduced availability.

This phenomenon, known as scintillation, is governed by the space weather conditions, time of the day, season, local distribution of the geomagnetic field, etc. All these factors make ionospheric scintillation both highly variable in space and time. Moreover, scintillation are intrinsically anisotropic since the associated scattering irregularities tend to align and stretch along the geomagnetic field lines. Depending on the relative position of signal source, the receiving station, and the irregularity, the scintillation effect on the transmitted wave might be enhanced or reduced. This study is focused on the consistent accounting of this geometric effect in scintillation modeling with the emphasis on situations when the communication or sensing sender-receiver link is nearly horizontal. For this task the single phase screen model has been used to model the scattering of propagating radio signals on random ionospheric layer. The geometric enhancement effect of scintillation is demonstrated by considering communication links via a geostationary beacon satellite over the equator.

This phenomenon is called \"ionospheric scintillation\" or simply \"scintillation\", and it leads to the deterioration of communication quality between the ground and satellites and the disturbance of image data transmitted from satellites. This phenomenon has been known for a long time and affects satellite communications such as Inmarsat in Japan (Karasawa et al. 1985). In addition, during the US Army's al-Qaeda sweeping operation \"Operation Anaconda\" in Afghanistan in March 2002, the UHF satellite communication (SATCOM) failure caused fatalities among US troops. It has been pointed out that a plasma bubble may have caused the failure (Kelly et al. 2014). The higher the frequency, the smaller the effect of ionospheric scintillation. It is almost negligible in satellite communication systems with frequencies above 10 GHz compared with other effects such as the troposphere. On the other hand, in satellite communication systems of the L-band at 1.5 GHz and the S band at 2 GHz, the effect of scintillation due to plasma bubbles cannot be ignored. The longer the radio wave propagation path through the plasma bubble, which usually extends in the north-south direction along the magnetic field line, the greater the effect becomes. Therefore, in Japan, it is considered that communication with GEO satellites and other low-elevation-angle satellites could be greatly affected by plasma bubbles (Karasawa et al. 1985).

All the models embedded in the tool rely on approximations of the main factors affecting the navigation signal propagation. The signal propagation requires the modelling of the interaction of an electromagnetic wave with the atmosphere, precisely two layers: the ionosphere and the troposphere. Several phenomena like refraction, scintillation, and multipath need to be considered. For the sake of simplicity, only the refraction is considered by the tool. Both the ionosphere and the troposphere can cause the refraction of the signal for different reasons, with the result of the signal deviation from the straight path and the introduction of a delay in the reception of the signal.

By consequence, under these perturbed conditions coming from the outer space, the ionosphere may become highly turbulent and the probability of irregularities formation, typically enhancements or depletions of the electron density embedded in the ambient ionosphere, increases. Such irregularities cause diffraction effects, mainly due to the random fluctuations of the refractive index of the ionosphere, on the satellites signals passing through them and consequent perturbations may cause GNSS navigation errors and outages, abruptly corrupting its performance. Due to the morphology of the geomagnetic field, whose lines are almost vertical at high latitude, polar areas are characterized by the presence of significant ionospheric irregularities having scale sizes ranging from hundreds of kilometres down to a few centimetres and with highly dynamic structures.

Satellite Navigation Systems One of the largest sources of error in global positioning systems (GPS) or precision navigation and timing systems (PNT) signals is due to the passage of the satellite signal through the relatively dense electron environment of the upper atmosphere. These errors are typically compensated for by using correction models. During ionospheric storms or periods where the ionosphere deviates from normal conditions the models may be inadequate and lead to errors. Precision navigation systems that autocorrect for the ionosphere, such as differential GPS, may be susceptible to errors during severe ionospheric storms. GPS may also be susceptible to interference from solar radio bursts in the UHF range, leading to significant loss of satellite availability for tens of minutes (in severe cases). High-Frequency Communications Background radiation produced by the sun in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray range is typically absorbed at altitudes above 90 km, in a region known as the ionosphere.

In this article, the authors discussed the sleep problems of astronauts. Despite its challenging topic, the paper authored by Wu et al. has at least one major shortcoming. This issue is related to the observation that the sleep pattern of astronauts can be disturbed by light flash phenomenon. Since the first report by astronaut E.E. Aldrin in 1969, many astronauts have reported light flashes. These visually perceived flashes of light occurred in different shapes but they apparently moved across the visual field of astronauts and possibly caused, at least to some extent, sleep problems. Moreover, the countermeasures proposed by the authors may improve astronauts\u2019 sleep pattern, but they do not address the root cause of the light flashes (i.e., heavy ion interactions outside the shielding provided by the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere).

NASA\u2019s Human Research Program (HRP) is simulating space radiation on Earth following upgrades to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Brookhaven National Laboratory. These upgrades help researchers on Earth learn more about the effects of ionizing space radiation, to help keep astronauts safe on a journey to Mars. Radiation is one of the most dangerous risks to humans in space, and one of the most challenging to simulate here on Earth. The risk to human health significantly increases when astronauts travel beyond Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) outside the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere shields Earth from solar particle events (SPEs) and radiation caused by the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) produced by supernova fragments. Radiation particles like ions can be dangerous to humans because they can pass through skin, depositing energy and damaging cells or DNA along the way. This damage can increase the risk for diseases later in life or cause radiation sickness during the mission. Radiation may cause damage to the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and circulatory system of astronauts.

(Source/Credits: National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Effects on human body The intense radiation from violent space weather can affect human DNA or cell replications. Astronauts in space, if not properly protected from the dangerous radiation, may be adversely affected. Flight at high altitudes may also result in a higher dose of radiation at the height of solar activity. Astronauts working in space have protective clothing against radiation. Effects on Communication and Navigation Systems To enable long-distance communication, many telecommunication systems transmit radio signals via the ionosphere. Electromagnetic waves produced by solar flares may disturb the ionosphere and interfere with radio signals, resulting in degraded communication quality. Maritime and aviation navigation systems use low frequency signals to locate vessels or aircraft. Intense solar activity may generate inaccuracy in information in these systems, causing errors in the positioning of vehicles. Effects on Electric Power and Pipelines Occurrence of geomagnetic storms (i.e. severe distortion of geomagnetic field of the Earth) can induce electric current in oil pipelines and electric cables. Flow meters may be affected, giving incorrect reading. The rate of corrosion of pipeline may also increase. The abnormal current induced in power grids may damage transformers because of overheating. During the great geomagnetic storm in 1989, transformer failures resulted in electricity suspension in Quebec for 9 hours.

They break free for practical purposes where the mesosphere and thermosphere merge at an altitude that averages about 60 miles (95 kilometers). Frictional heat consumes space vehicles of all kinds when they reenter Earth's atmosphere at high velocities unless a shield protects exteriors and insulation keeps crews (if any) and other contents acceptably cool. Apollo command modules returning from the Moon, for example, had to offset 5,000 \u00b0F (1,900 \u00b0C), four times that of blast furnaces. Friction nevertheless exerts some positive effects. Aerodynamic drag at the interface where atmosphere and space imperceptibly merge can act as a brake or alter orbit configurations without burning fuel, provided computers calculate reentry angles correctly. Spacecraft skip or bounce back erratically when trajectories are too shallow and incineration results when they are too steep, but reentry windows as a rule open wider for powered vehicles than for those that glide. #### **GRAVITY** Propulsion systems must be powerful enough to boost military spacecraft into orbit, despite atmospheric drag and gravity (g), which keeps objects on Earth without an anchor and pulls unsupported bodies from atmosphere or space toward the surface.

This causes the trajectory to intersect the atmosphere about 8000 km from the base at an altitude of 120 km. This location is known as the Entry Interface and is where the entry stage begins. The flight path angle at this point will be a couple of degrees below the horizontal. The entry angle is more or less fixed by the geometry of the orbit and there is little room for optimization of this parameter unless you are returning from interplanetary space.

Is there a similar problem when it is going the other way, at take off? It is going through the same amount of air and acceleration looks quite similar to deceleration, only the other way around.\" The only answer that I could think of is that a good part of the acceleration might take place at higher altitudes where there is less air, and braking is done only by using the atmosphere. Going up, it is the rocket engine which provides acceleration and energy. Because air resistance robs energy and is undesirable, the rocket deliberately rises vertically, to go though the denser atmosphere as quickly as possible. The vehicle gets most of its velocity, and almost all of the kinetic energy, at high altitudes where"}, {"title": "rpj_common_crawl_2020_05", "text": "which would normally become self-luminous around 104 Kilometers in altitude.

Several of the papers I\u2019ve read introduce an interaction parameter term, Q, that relates the relative strength of the Lorentz forces to drag forces. The relationship takes the form: Equation 1 (from Otsu et al) Sigma is the conductivity of the weakly ionized plasma, B is the magnetic field strength, L is a reference length (I think related to the magnet configuration), rho is atmospheric density, and V is velocity. As you can see, for a given magnet, the drag forces start dominating as the conductivity drops and as the atmospheric density increases. Atmospheric density increases dramatically as you descend from orbit, so for a reentry application, you get most of your benefit from the first little bit of descent.

You don't need much mass to have a high impact. CFCs have concentrations in the parts per billion range, but with their lifetime of decades can and do break down large amounts of ozone. So we can't simply dismiss the problem based on atmospheric mass considerations alone. The materials from which satellites are built are different from propellants involved in launch. Therefore, you can't simply dismiss satellites as far less massive than rocket propellants and therefore declare the impact of re-entry negligible compared to the the impact of launch. Much of a satellite material is metal, which will deposit rather quickly (see next question), but other materials could in theory have an impact (John et al. considered paint and concluded its impact was negligible). Some satellites contain unusual materials: for example, Kosmos 1402 was a Soviet spy satellite containing a nuclear reactor and thus fuel.

It is time to introduce the notion of the boundary layer, which is a zone where fluid \u201csticks\u201d to and object according to its physical profile and the viscosity of the fluid. During our atmospheric entry, this layer limit will serve as a real \u201cair cushion\u201d and will push the shockwave farther away from the surface of the object, and will also push away the heat!

After having endured the extreme temperatures of compression and plasma, as well as the aerodynamic forces of reentry, our object slows down more and more due to the shockwaves and air friction.

The magnetic interaction parameter (Qmhd) introduced in my first post in this series can easily be in the 250-1000+ range at high altitudes compared to down in the 5-50 range you might see during atmospheric reentry. For example, the paper I cited in my first article (Otsu et al) showed that for a vehicle coming back from a GTO-like orbit, you could cut the return time by 70% with a 0.1T magnet, which is about 5x weaker than the magnet assumed for most of the reentry magnetic TPS studies. While magnetic effects may be helpful for reentry, they truly come into their own for aerobraking and aerocapture. For most previous Mars and Venus aerobraking missions, velocity changes in the 1-1.2km/s range have taken between 70-150 days, over several hundred passes.

Crew Dragon is one of those spacecraft that simply fall down to the Earth on a pre-calculated trajectory. Once the spacecraft has been carefully navigated to fall through the re-entry corridor, the thermodynamics comes into play. The air, as we know, is composed of mainly two diatomic molecules: oxygen and nitrogen. Ordinarily, when air pressure is low, they remain in this diatomic state. However, under special circumstances like atmospheric re-entry, they behave differently. During re-entry, as the spacecraft falls under gravity and enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the increasing density of the atmosphere combined with the tremendous speed of the spacecraft (of the order of 7-8,000 metres per second) causes a shock wave leading to an enormous rise in the pressure in front of it. At approximately 70 to 80 km above Earth, this pressure becomes so large that it causes the diatomic oxygen and (after some time) nitrogen to split causing further reactions. These reactions are extremely exothermic \u2013 meaning they release a lot of heat. This heat is so significant that we need special arrangements to protect what\u2019s inside the spacecraft.

The shuttles were gliders, meaning they were able to adjust their flight pattern to help reduce the amount of heat building up including S turns, making re-entry not too dissimilar from landing in an airplane. First, the shuttle flew backward to slow down from orbit speed, and then the orbital maneuvering engines (OMS) would thrust it out of orbit and toward Earth. Next, the shuttle turned nose-first once out of orbit and entered the atmosphere with its belly down toward the atmosphere to use drag along its blunt bottom to help slow it down and then pull the nose up to about 40 degrees.

The vehicle's velocity is reduced due to friction against the air. This causes the heat build-up and the ionization. A vessel using powered reentry could kill its own velocity and nose in to fly to its target with minimal heat build-up. Therefore, no ionization black out.

Let's pretend for a moment that the atmosphere had sea-level density, pressure, and temperature all the way up to, say 500km high, and then would abruptly end in a complete vaccum. In such a situation you could have a glider orbiting at 501km high which could do a very graceful, low temperature reentry by simply slowing down the angular velocity and then using aerodynamic lift at, say, a 1:30 gliding ratio to drastically reduce the rate in which potential energy gets released. Or even have a completely vertical entry using a simple parachute.. With our real atmosphere though it seems that all reentries are at very steep angles and at very high radial velocities. Why? Is this a direct consequence of the low density at high altitudes, which necessitates a far higher velocity to reach the same lift/drag, and that high velocity contributes to increasing the temperature far more than the low density contributes to decreasing the temperature? A: by simply slowing down the angular velocity As simple as this sounds, it is a huge problem in practice. The orbital speed is roughly 17,000 mph.

For this it uses the atmosphere to dissipate its kinetic energy. Due to the speed of entry into the atmosphere, air molecules are quickly compacted in front of the spacecraft. These impacted molecules obtain some of the spacecraft\u2019s energy but are unable to move out of the way because of the neighboring molecules around them. The energetic molecules generate heat. If this heat is not managed properly it will build up in the surrounding gas and subject the spacecraft to extreme temperatures that could destroy it. As the reentry continues, the atmosphere becomes thicker very quickly which will stress its structure and its occupants. These stresses are measured as the g-level. A g-level is equal to the acceleration due to gravity. A g-level of 10 would mean that you would weigh 10 times as much as normal, and that the wings would be trying to hold ten times the weight. If this is experienced for an extended amount of time it can cause damage. Both the g-levels and the heat transfer to the ship need to be managed carefully during the entry into the atmosphere.

According to NASA, the gap fillers, which each serve different purposes, are not required for reentry. One filler prevents \"chattering\" of tiles during ascent, which would occur due to the sonic booms from the noses of the solid rocket boosters and the external fuel tank. The other, in a different location where there is a wider gap between tiles, simply functions to reduce the gap size between tiles, which in turn reduces heat transfer to the shuttle. Even without this filler NASA did not expect the increased heat to cause a problem during reentry (it is present to avoid a level of heating which would only be problematic if experienced many times over a vehicle's design life). Since the gap fillers are not necessary for re-entry, it was acceptable to simply pull them out.

This energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. The theory behind reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat reaching the vehicle, and the remainder heats up the atmosphere. Landing and recovery The Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules all splashed down in the sea. These capsules were designed to land at relatively low speeds with the help of a parachute. Soviet/Russian capsules for Soyuz make use of a big parachute and braking rockets to touch down on land. Spaceplanes like the Space Shuttle land like a glider. After a successful landing the spacecraft, its occupants, and cargo can be recovered.

Crew Dragon is one of those spacecraft that simply fall down to the Earth on a pre-calculated trajectory. Once the spacecraft has been carefully navigated to fall through the re-entry corridor, the thermodynamics comes into play. The air, as we know, is composed of mainly two diatomic molecules: oxygen and nitrogen. Ordinarily, when air pressure is low, they remain in this diatomic state. However, under special circumstances like atmospheric re-entry, they behave differently. During re-entry, as the spacecraft falls under gravity and enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the increasing density of the atmosphere combined with the tremendous speed of the spacecraft (of the order of 7-8,000 metres per second) causes a shock wave leading to an enormous rise in the pressure in front of it. At approximately 70 to 80 km above Earth, this pressure becomes so large that it causes the diatomic oxygen and (after some time) nitrogen to split causing further reactions. These reactions are extremely exothermic \u2013 meaning they release a lot of heat. This heat is so significant that we need special arrangements to protect what\u2019s inside the spacecraft.

In recognition of the increasing number of objects in space, NASA has adopted guidelines and assessment procedures to minimize the number of non-operational spacecraft and spent rocket upper stages orbiting the Earth. One method of post-mission disposal is reentry of these spacecraft and upper stage launch systems, either from orbital decay (uncontrolled entry) or with a controlled entry. In order to preserve reentry options, launch and payload developers include reentry capabilities in the designs and margins of new systems. Today these self termination capabilities include sufficient fuel, larger propulsion, and system flexibility to insure that the means to fire engines remain to achieve a lower altitude perigee. Once there repeated exposure to higher atmospheric drag will accelerate the process of spacecraft reentry. Controlled entry normally occurs by driving the spacecraft to enter the atmosphere at a steeper flight path angle.

Rather than having conventional wings, some of these spacecraft might be 'lifting bodies' in which the vehicle's curved shape provides the required lift within the atmosphere. Some of them might be launched vertically like rockets and some might fly out to the upper atmosphere like an airplane before making the transition to orbit, as we saw earlier in this chapter. However the same problem remained: all of the energy used to get the craft into orbit would have to be dissipated in order to get it back to Earth. And most of that energy was going to manifest as heat. Which meant all that heat had to be handled somehow. You either had to endure it or get rid of it. Many of these early studies were really concerned with suborbital aircraft rather than true spacecraft: vehicles which could climb to the edge of space without quite enough velocity to actually achieve orbit before flying back down through the atmosphere to a landing halfway round the world.

Reentry refers to the return of a spacecraft into Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The blanket of relatively dense gas surrounding Earth is useful as a braking, or retarding, force resulting from aerodynamic drag. A concomitant effect, however, is the severe heating caused by the compression of atmospheric air in front of the rapidly moving spacecraft. Initially, heat shields were made of ablative materials that carried away the heat of reentry as they were shed, but the space shuttle introduced refractory materials\u2014silica tiles and a reinforced carbon-carbon material\u2014that withstood the heat directly. Newer vehicle designs use active cooling and refractory metallic alloys. Inherent in the safe reentry of a spacecraft is precise control of the angle of reentry. For Apollo, this angle with respect to Earth\u2019s horizon was \u22126.2\u00b0. If the reentry angle is too shallow, the spacecraft will skip or bounce off the atmosphere and back into space. If the angle is too great, the heat shield will not survive the extreme heating rates nor the spacecraft the high forces of deceleration. Returning Apollo Command Modules approached Earth at nearly 40,000 km (25,000 miles) per hour. Even with a satisfactory reentry angle, the capsules\u2019 heat shields were subjected to temperatures approaching 3,000 \u00b0C (5,400 \u00b0F). During the final phases of descent, some spacecraft\u2014especially capsule-type manned craft\u2014deploy parachutes, which lower the vehicle to a soft landing.

The existing RLV reentry guidance methods often take a single spacecraft as the research object and do not have the ability of coordinated reentry flight. To solve these problems, a coordinated reentry guidance scheme is designed. In this paper, a time coordination strategy is designed aiming at the predictability of reentry flight time. The pseudospectral method is used to predict the flight time of RLVs, and the coordinated flight time coordination of multiple RLVs is realized. Based on receding horizon control, a coordinated reentry guidance law is designed. In each guidance cycle, RLV flies according to the guidance instructions generated in the previous guidance cycle. At the same time, taking the previous reentry trajectory as the initial value and the coordinated flight time determined by the time coordination algorithm as the constraint condition, the pseudo-spectral method is used to generate the flight trajectory quickly. The angle of attack and inclination are used as guidance instructions for the next guidance cycle of RLV, so as to guide RLV to the target. Finally, the simulation results verify the performance of the reentry coordinated guidance law and the effectiveness of the whole reentry guidance scheme."}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "bit.

A vehicle entering an atmosphere from space goes through extreme conditions. The majority of the entry energy is dissipated through friction with the atmosphere, resulting in extreme heating that must be dissipated; for example, the leading edge of the Apollo heatshield reached over 2500 degrees Celsius (Launius and Jenkins 2012). Drag causes enormous forces on the reentry vehicle; for example, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 Reusable (F9R) weighs about 35 metric tons and has a peak deceleration of six times Earth gravity on reentry. Winds push around the reentry vehicle, with high-altitude winds at Earth regularly exceeding 100 miles per hour. Communication may be denied for all or part of reentry as ionized air around the spacecraft interferes with radio communications; for example, the Apollo 13 return capsule endured a 6-minute blackout. And finally, a spacecraft operating outside of Earth orbit is subject to high radiation, which can be fatal for electronics. This is especially true of missions operating near Jupiter, where the radiation environment is particularly intense. Small Margin for Error With most landings, the first attempt must be a success or the vehicle will be destroyed on impact. Moreover, additional propellant is rarely available for a second landing attempt. For large rocket engines, throttling down to a hover is technically challenging and inefficient\u2014every second spent hovering is wasted propellant. For F9R, the rocket has to hit zero velocity at exactly zero altitude. If it reaches zero velocity too low, it will crash; if it reaches"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "(24 kph). Thunderbolts, such as the one that destroyed a U.S. Atlas-Centaur rocket laden with a multimillion dollar communications satellite in March 1987, pose similar hazards. **Figure 22. _Aerospace Interfaces_** Spacecraft must overcome strong aerodynamic drag immediately after launch, but resistance becomes progressively weaker as they rise through the troposphere, because thinner air bears down with less pressure and the amount of fuel expended lightens the load they must lift. They break free for practical purposes where the mesosphere and thermosphere merge at an altitude that averages about 60 miles (95 kilometers). Frictional heat consumes space vehicles of all kinds when they reenter Earth's atmosphere at high velocities unless a shield protects exteriors and insulation keeps crews (if any) and other contents acceptably cool. Apollo command modules returning from the Moon, for example, had to offset 5,000 \u00b0F (1,900 \u00b0C), four times that of blast furnaces. Friction nevertheless exerts some positive effects. Aerodynamic drag at the interface where atmosphere and space imperceptibly merge can act as a brake or alter orbit configurations without burning fuel, provided computers calculate reentry angles correctly. Spacecraft skip or bounce back erratically when trajectories are too shallow and incineration results when they are too steep, but reentry windows as a rule open wider for powered vehicles than for those that glide. #### **GRAVITY** Propulsion systems must be powerful enough to boost military spacecraft into orbit, despite atmospheric drag and gravity (g), which keeps objects on Earth without an anchor and pulls unsupported bodies from atmosphere or space toward the surface.

Etymology: The word supersonic comes from two Latin derived words; 1) super: above and 2) sonus: sound, which together mean above sound, or faster than sound. Supersonic objects The tip of a bullwhip is thought to be the first object designed to break the sound barrier, resulting in the telltale \"crack\" (actually a small sonic boom). The wave motion travelling through the bullwhip is what makes it capable of achieving supersonic speeds. However, the first man-made supersonic boom was likely caused by a piece of cloth, spurring the whip's eventual development. Most modern firearm bullets are supersonic, with rifle projectiles often travelling at speeds approaching and in some cases well exceeding Mach 3. Most spacecraft are supersonic at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low air densities. During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30 km (~98,400 feet) to reduce air drag. Note that the speed of sound decreases somewhat with altitude, due to lower temperatures found there (typically up to 25 km). At even higher altitudes the temperature starts increasing, with the corresponding increase in the speed of sound. When an inflated balloon is burst, the torn pieces of latex contract at supersonic speed, which contributes to the sharp and loud popping noise.

This is another way to explain the performance penalty associated with establishing the safe perigee of a parking orbit. Plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in Earth orbit, such as NASA's Project Orion and Russia's Kliper/Parom tandem. Astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories, particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects. Astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use. An orbital maneuvering system may be needed to maintain or change orbits. Non-rocket orbital propulsion methods include solar sails, magnetic sails, plasma-bubble magnetic systems, and using gravitational slingshot effects. The term \"transfer energy\" means the total amount of energy imparted by a rocket stage to its payload. This can be the energy imparted by a first stage of a launch vehicle to an upper stage plus payload, or by an upper stage or spacecraft kick motor to a spacecraft. Vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy. This energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere. Typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating. The theory behind reentry was developed by Harry Julian Allen. Based on this theory, reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry. Blunt shapes mean that less than 1% of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle, and the remainder heats up the atmosphere."}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "orbit for several days before conducting a series of de-orbit burns for a destructive re-entry over the Pacific Ocean on Saturday.

Glory is required to meet NASA safety standard 1740.14, Guidelines and Assessment Procedures for Limiting Orbital Debris. The post-mission disposal method chosen for Glory is an uncontrolled atmospheric reentry option. Specifically, Guideline 7-1 requires the spacecraft to complete a Reentry Survivability Analysis (RSA). The guideline's intent is to limit the risk of human casualty by minimizing the surviving components of a spacecraft. Adjustments can be made to the allowable debris casualty area (DCA) depending on reentry year and inclination to keep the risk of human casualty constant (1 in 10,000). Recently Glory underwent a RSA, which was completed using two tools: the debris assessment software (DAS), version 1.5.3, and the object reentry survival analysis tool (ORSAT). The outcome of the RSA is very important to the mission. If the DCA is higher than the allowable, then the mission must pursue one of the possible resolutions that are discussed. If the ORSAT results are the end products that are assessed for policy compliance, then why use DAS at all? If done early DAS analysis can provide an indication of components that should be more carefully analyzed, which can indicate if steps should be taken in the design prior to a potential impact. DAS also helps prepare inputs for ORSAT, which has different input methods, but the information needed is much the same.

Days Improve Orbital Decay Predictions Posted December 15, 2015 6:21 PM Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System Scientists are learning more about how the upper atmosphere and ionosphere affect space satellites as well as communications and navigation here on Earth, thanks to new data from a U.S. Air Force satellite that recently completed a more than seven-year mission. The Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere during a planned reentry on Nov. 28, leaving behind a treasure trove of data about a part of the space environment that's difficult to study. The unique set of sustained observations from C/NOFS will greatly improve models currently used to predict satellite trajectories, orbital drag and uncontrolled re-entry. Scientists from the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the University of Texas (UT) at Dallas are presenting the results at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco. Launched on April 16, 2008, C/NOFS studied a region high above in our atmosphere called the ionosphere, a layer of electrically charged particles created by ultra-violet radiation from the sun. This layer lies some 40 to 600 miles above the Earth's surface, where it interacts and co-mingles with the neutral particles of the tenuous upper atmosphere. The upper atmosphere and ionosphere change constantly in response to forces from above and below, including explosions on the sun, intense upper atmosphere winds, and dynamic electric field changes. In addition to interfering with satellite orbits, such changes can produce turbulence in the ionosphere that cause what's known as scintillations, which interfere with"}, {"title": "rpj_common_crawl_2022_05", "text": "has weather.

Radio signals can and do collide with other objects in space, and definitely do disperse between the spacecraft and the Earth, but they will reach the Earth for two reasons. The first; even though our solar system has a lot of stuff in it, the vast majority of it is still empty space. The second is that all spacecraft are equipped with finely tuned and precisely calibrated antennas, which allow them to aim their signal directly at the earth, rather than beaming its signal in every direction. Beaming signal in every direction would require a lot of power to produce, so it\u2019s much more efficient to use a smaller amount of power to limit the signal to only direction you care about, i.e., in the direction of Earth. Now, if you\u2019re a spacecraft orbiting another planet, you can easily imagine that the planet will occasionally get in the way of you beaming information back to the Earth. Radio signals do not go through planets, and nor do they go on curved paths. So the spacecraft, in these times, must be capable of running itself for a while, before it comes back around from the far side of the planet (from an Earthly perspective). During these times the spacecraft are always in a communications blackout, and totally unable to communicate with us on Earth.

Finally, as we saw in Chap. , high speed entry into an atmosphere can generate a lot of heat. One consequence of this can be the creation of an envelope of ionized atmospheric gases around the craft, which interferes with or even totally blocks radio communications. Spacecraft returning to Earth will experience this comms blackout, as will probes landing on any other celestial body with enough of an atmosphere. The result is always several very tense minutes during which ground controllers have no idea what is happening to their craft. ## Engineering Success Regardless of how it is controlled, when you delve into the details of almost any space-based mission, at first it may seem rather astonishing how often something goes wrong at some point. When you pause and reflect, you may change that view.

Constant exposure to ionising radiation, cosmic rays, and large temperature changes mean that electronic systems need to be designed with shielding, fail-safes, and redundancies in mind. While one would assume that modern spacecraft are filled to the brim with the latest technology, that is rarely the case. The major problem with space missions is that once a craft leaves Earth, there is very little that can be done when things go awry, especially during unmanned missions. That is why it is far more important to use technology that has been tried and tested which means that some of the components that make it into the spacecraft can be years or even decades old. You might ask, why do engineers go to such lengths to put electronic systems on spacecraft? Well, as it turns out, virtually every aspect of modern spaceflight relies on electronics. Key systems like navigation, communications, telemetry, and sensors are made possible thanks to electronics. Moreover, any unmanned missions, which make up the vast majority of space missions, would be impossible without electronics that enable the spacecraft to be controlled from Earth. Taking it a step further, probes that conduct missions in deep space need to be able to make their own, real-time decisions. This also necessitates the use of computers.

A comprehensive study of detailed communication coverage over the entire mission was conducted in Phase B across multiple SPP subsystem teams. Because of the unique operation environment of the SPP mission, many factors must be understood in order to maintain adequate communications with the spacecraft. First, the highly elliptical solar orbits across the inner solar system cause frequent solar conjunctions, sometimes with extended periods.

The X-band is baselined for spacecraft tracking for navigation and works for both uplink and downlink modes. The Ka-band is mainly for science data downlink and works only for the downlink mode.

(International Foundation for Telemetering, 2001-10) For every space mission, there are challenges with the launch site/field operations process that are addressed too late in the development cycle. This potentially causes schedule delays, cost overruns, and adds risk to the mission success. This paper will discuss how a single interface, representing the payload at the launch site in all phases of development, will mitigate risk, and minimize or even alleviate potential problems later on. Experience has shown that a single interface between the project and the launch site allows for issues to be worked in a timely manner and bridges the gap between two diverse cultures.

This is the reason why using the planetary flybys is a very smart solution to overcome the unavoidable mass constraints at launch. When a spacecraft enters and exits from a planetary sphere of influence, its energy with respect to the planet does not change, while it changes with respect to the Sun. Indeed, during the approach, an exchange of energy with the planet occurs: the spacecraft kinetic energy progressively increases to a maximum (named \u2018closest approach\u2019, or CA), while at the same time the gravitational potential energy decreases. The opposite happens when the spacecraft departs from the planets. However, the spacecraft velocity relative to the planet is the same at the arrival and departure; while the spacecraft velocity relative to the Sun is increased or decreased depending on the geometry of the approach. Of course, the energy conservation law is is still valid: hence, the kinetic energy gained by the spacecraft (in terms of velocity) during the flyby is lost from the planet, since its velocity is decreased during the flyby with respect to the Sun (but, as the mass of the planet is a factor 1021 bigger than the satellite mass, the change in velocity is negligible and not clearly visible).

Part of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

As if all that were not bad enough, one of the two star trackers, devices that recognize patterns of stars just as you might recognize constellations to determine your orientation at night without a compass or other aids, was no longer functional. Further complicating the effort to get the mission back on track was an antenna at the Deep Space Network that needed to be taken out of service for emergency repairs. And the entire situation was exacerbated by Dawn already being in its lowest altitude orbit around Ceres (the subject of next month's log), so for part of every 5.5-hour orbital revolution, it was out of contact as the world beneath it blocked the radio signal.

The communication system provides the uplink, downlink and navigation service communication to Earth through NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network (DSN). The 0.6 m HGA, mounted on the anti-ram side of the spacecraft, provides high rate Ka-band science data downlink. Fanbeam antennas, also on the anti-ram side, are used for X-band uplink and lower rate housekeeping data downlink. Two low gain antennas, one on the ram side and one on the anti-ram side, provide near omni-directional coverage and are used primarily for launch and early operations, trajectory correction maneuvers, portions of solar encounter and emergency communication.

Neither the visible light from the Sun nor the radio waves from a spacecraft qualify as \"very energetic\". In short, there is no interference. There is a problem if (for example) Mars is close to being directly behind the Sun as seen from the perspective of the Earth.

The other problem appeared to be with one of the AACS computers; the spacecraft switched to a backup computer during the Titan burn, and initial data transmissions were incomplete. Early analysis seemed to indicate that an event during the launch itself, rather than a faulty spacecraft computer system, was the cause of the data loss. At first, on August 23, officials suspected that perhaps the spacecraft had been bumped by the rocket motor one hour after liftoff and again about seventeen hours later, when telemetry signals indicated that the spacecraft had been jolted. However, by the next day, flight engineers determined that electronic gyrations in the AACS seemed to have caused the difficulty.

Transit, one of the first operational satellite systems, was also known as the Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS). The Transit spacecraft were originally developed for updating the inertial navigation systems on board US Navy Polaris submarines, and were later made available for civilian use. Transit receivers used the known characteristics of the satellite's orbit, measured the Doppler shift of the satellite's radio signal, and thereby calculated the receivers position on Earth. As a single spacecraft travelled overhead, the user measured the Doppler shift over a 15 minute period by receiving timing marks and satellite orbital information on two separate frequencies, 149.99 and 399.97 MHz. These signals were corrected for ionospheric refraction and the information was then fed into the users navigation system. Individual Transit satellites operated for over 10 years. Technical breakthroughs during the program included gravity gradient stabilization, use of radio-isotope thermoelectic generators (RTG), and navigation satellite technologies later used in the GPS system.

In a worst case scenario an aircraft can lose contact with its surroundings. Oil tankers can struggle with precise navigation. In order to more precisely predict when radio communications and navigation will fail, researchers require more information about what happens when violent solar winds hit the Earth and produce the northern lights. The solar winds consist of charged particles and produce powerful turbulence in the ionosphere, which consists of plasma clouds with electrical particles at an altitude of 80 to 500 km.

One of the outstanding questions about Mars is how it came to lose most of its atmosphere. One possibility is that the solar wind, the stream of charged particles flowing out from the Sun, has gradually stripped the atmosphere away through interactions with the ionosphere.

After three and a half years of design and construction, the 145-kg satellite was flown to California and launched from the Pacific Missile Range at 2:06 a.m. (EST) on Saturday, September 29, 1962 . Sprung from a two-stage Thor-Agena rocket, Alouette-I was quickly put into a near perfect 1000 km orbit and soon began its top-down study of the ionosphere. Alouette-I was a tremendous success by any measure. The conservative research approach adopted by the DRTE team paid off manyfold as the satellite eventually stretched its one-year design life into an unprecedented 10-year mission, producing over one million images of the ionosphere in the process. Following the success of Alouette-I, Canada and United States signed an agreement to launch further satellites under a new program called International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies (ISIS). Under the program, the Alouette back-up model was refurbished and flown in 1965 as \" Alouette-II \" and two new satellites, named ISIS I and ISIS II, were successfully launched in 1969 and 1970 respectively.

The bus used for SWOT is TASs newest satellite bus to meet Frances Space Operations Act. This act aims to limit space debris and lower the risk of atmospheric reentry over inhabited areas. The new bus will allow any satellite using the bus to control itself during reentry to ensure a safe disposal. The satellite bus will be used to house many components to support the payload suite. The bus is placed below the suite when construction is complete. It will use an S-band antenna to allow radio communications between the spacecraft and ground stations.

What happens after is dependent on a variety of factors, notable among them being the frequency of the waves and the density of the free electrons. For AM waves, given the right conditions, they will essentially bounce back and forth between the ground and the ionosphere, propagating the signal farther and farther. So clearly the ionosphere can potentially play an important part in the terrestrial radio process. But it is the constantly shifting nature of the ionosphere that makes things really interesting.

In any event, the ionosphere\u2019s composition changes most drastically at night, primarily because, of course, the Sun goes missing for a bit. Without as abundant a source of ionizing rays, the D and E levels (pictured right) of the ionosphere cease to be very ionized, but the F region (particularly F2) still remains quite ionized.

However, I think lower frequencies can\u2019t be used due to being reflected off of the I. The E-Band probably would have no problem getting through.

In movies, normal people are often put in situations where they have to land a plane. How do satellites survive the thermosphere? Many satellites orbit within the thermosphere and changes in the density of (the very, very thin) air at orbital altitudes, brought on by heating and expansion of the thermosphere, generates a drag force on satellites. These waves and tides help move energy around within the atmosphere, including the thermosphere. How does the ionosphere work? The ionized part of the Earth's atmosphere is known as the ionosphere. Ultraviolet light from the sun collides with atoms in this region knocking electrons loose. This creates ions, or atoms with missing electrons. This process also works in reverse for radio waves produced on the earth. Is the ionosphere hot or cold? Due to fluxes in solar radiation, temperatures in the ionosphere vary from 200 Kelvin (or -99 degrees Fahrenheit) to 500K (or 440 degrees Fahrenheit). Where does the ionosphere start?

Ionization, the process in which electrons are stripped from atoms and produces electrically charged particles, results from solar radiation. When the ionosphere becomes heavily ionized, the gases may even glow and be visible. This phenomenon is known as Northern and Southern Lights. \u2022 Why is the ionosphere important in HF radio? Well, this blanket of gases is like nature\u2019s satellite, making HF BLOS radio communications possible. When radio waves strike these ionized layers, depending on frequency, some are completely absorbed, others are refracted so that they return to the earth, and still others pass through the ionosphere into outer space.

This is determined by wavelength and the type of transmitting antenna. Like a billiard ball bouncing off a rail, a radio wave reflects from the ionosphere at the same angle it hits it. Thus, the incident angle is an important factor in determining communications range.

However, when the sun sets, the molecules slowly start to recombine with their electrons and the free electron density levels drop. This means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed, leading to the interference phenomena we have mentioned. For these interference patterns to occur though, there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave. Otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard. The received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day. This suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets. Appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record. This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the sun\u2019s influence. At sunset, the intensity of the sun\u2019s radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than it is high up in the atmosphere.

High-energy light (mostly ultraviolet and X-rays) causes electrons to be stripped away from gas molecules and neutral atoms, forming ions (and free electrons). The incoming light is most intense at the upper edge of the atmosphere (before it is absorbed), but the density of atoms and molecules is higher at lower altitudes (with atmospheric density highest at the Earth\u2019s surface), leading to a peak in ionization in an intermediate region. Much of the interesting action in the ionosphere is in the regions between 60\u2013300 km up, where the electron density is highest (though still very low compared to sea level).[1] Under many conditions, radio waves between 160 m and 10 m (with frequencies of 1.8\u201330 MHz) can be refracted by the ionosphere, enabling wireless communication around the globe. This long-distance propagation is, at least to me, a wondrous phenomenon. Effectively, there is a low-frequency limit below which the radio waves are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere. At a sufficiently high frequency, the radio waves will not refract back down to Earth, and will simply pass into space. However, in the Goldilocks zone between those two frequencies (the lowest usable frequency and maximum usable frequency), propagation can occur.

In the high atmosphere, above about 50 kilometers (30 miles), the air particles are separated so far that collisions between them are far less frequent than in the lower atmosphere, and when an air particle is ionized by ultraviolet radiation from the sun it remains ionized for a considerable time. Therefore at any given time a large proportion of the air particles are in an ionized condition. This does not occur much below about 50 kilometers (30 miles), because the ionizing radiations from the sun are largely absorbed in the higher regions of the atmosphere. Likewise there is not very great ionization density above about 400 kilometers (250 miles), because the air is so rare at such heights that there are not enough atoms to provide for great ionization density.

In a region extending from a height of about 90 km to over thousands of kms, most of the molecules of the atmosphere are ionized by radiation from the Sun. This region is called the ionosphere. At greater heights- intensity of ionizing radiation is very high, few molecules are available for ionization, ionisation density is low As height decreases- more molecules are available due to reduced atmospheric pressure, ionization density is higher (closer to the earth) But as height decreases further, ionization density decreases though more molecules are available since the energy in the ionizing radiation has been used up to create ions.

However, when the sun sets, the molecules slowly start to recombine with their electrons and the free electron density levels drop. This means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed, leading to the interference phenomena we have mentioned. For these interference patterns to occur though, there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave. Otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard. The received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day. This suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets. Appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record. This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the sun\u2019s influence. At sunset, the intensity of the sun\u2019s radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than it is high up in the atmosphere.

Since the atmosphere is bombarded by ultraviolet light waves of different frequencies, several ionized layers are formed at different altitudes. Lower frequency ultraviolet waves penetrate the atmosphere the least; therefore, they produce ionized layers at the higher altitudes. Conversely, ultraviolet waves of higher frequencies penetrate deeper and produce layers at the lower altitudes. An important factor in determining the density of ionized layers is the elevation angle of the sun, which changes frequently. For this reason, the height and thickness of the ionized layers vary, depending on the time of day and even the season of the year. Recombination Recall that the process of ionization involves ultraviolet light waves knocking electrons free from their atoms. A reverse process called RECOMBINATION occurs when the free electrons and positive ions collide with each other. Since these collisions are inevitable, the positive ions return to their original neutral atom state. The recombination process also depends on the time of day. Between the hours of early morning and late afternoon, the rate of ionization exceeds the rate of recombination. During this period, the ionized layers reach their greatest density and exert maximum influence on radio waves. During the late afternoon and early evening hours, however, the rate of recombination exceeds the rate of ionization, and the density of the ionized layers begins to decrease. Throughout the night, density continues to decrease, reaching a low point just before sunrise.

Now if all the radiation (charged particles) would be deflected, then we would not have an ozone layer, and we would not be protected from UV radiation. Ultraviolet (UV), X-ray and shorter wavelengths of solar radiation are ionizing, since photons at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge an electron from a neutral gas atom or molecule upon absorption. In this process the light electron obtains a high velocity so that the temperature of the created electronic gas is much higher (of the order of thousand K) than the one of ions and neutrals. The reverse process to ionization is recombination, in which a free electron is \"captured\" by a positive ion. Recombination occurs spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination. As gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process prevails, since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The balance between these two processes determines the quantity of ionization present. It is very important to understand that the solar wind could strip away the ozone layer.

At nighttime, when the number of charged particles in the lower layers drop, some of the radio waves can travel higher up into the ionosphere before they are absorbed.

It consists of several layers: D-layer at height 50 \u2212 90 km; E-layer at 90 \u2212 140 km; and F-layer at heights above 140 km (Davies 1990;Evans & Hagfors 1968).

Particles in the upper atmosphere become ionized from the Sun\u2019s electromagnetic radiation as well as impacts from magnetospheric energetic electrons (Borovsky and Valdivia, 2018). The ionosphere is particularly important in radio wave propagation around the globe. During the day, the lower layers of the ionosphere (D and E layers) are ionized by sunlight and block access of radio waves to the highest layer, the F layer.

The highest layer of the ionosphere, the F layer, has such a low density that recombination does not take place, and the layer remains ionized.

Particles from the sunspots are caught in the earth's magnetic field and find their way into the ionosphere. The F layer (responsible for most long-distance radio communication) is weakened. Signals either pass through this layer into space or are weakly reflected. The D layer absorbs an abnormal number of radio signals passing through this region, further reducing signal strengths. Sunspots, or explosions on the surface of the sun, are caused by factors unknown to us at this time. These explosions release a shower of particles that have been recorded by satellites launched specifically for this purpose.

One of the more prominent scientists involved in early investigations of the ionosphere was Sidney Chapman, who in 1931 published a paper dealing with the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, and who, like E.O.

Eccles discovered that the refractive index of ionized gas was less than unity, leading to the interesting fact that radiowaves are bent away from the medium normal in a plasma environment and thus toward the horizontal. Joseph Larmor, in 1924, concluded that obliquely launched radiowaves at a specified frequency would be refracted downward, but could escape from the earth if the waves are launched above a certain critical angle. This leads to the notion of an ionospheric iris above a given transmitter through which waves may penetrate, and the existence of skip distances.

This is where auroras are made. Northern Lights over Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (source) The ionosphere has mirror-like effects, making it an excellent reflector of radio waves. Countless military and civilian operations rely on it for their communications systems, groups as diverse as the U.S. Navy and the BBC. Much of the ionospheric research mentioned here is done, in large part, because of concerns that such communications will be disrupted or even shut down entirely by solar activity or \u201cenemy\u201d technology, but scientists are deeply interested in the chemical composition and behaviour of the ionosphere. Studying the ionosphere is problematic. Its lower levels are below the orbital altitudes needed for satellites, yet far too high up for balloons or aircraft. Nonetheless, ground-based tests utilizing sounding equipment (ionosondes) and satellites began in the early \u201960s. Then, in the mid-\u201960s, scientists hit upon the idea of using rockets to shoot barium into the ionosphere, creating \u201cclouds\u201d of barium particles that would be ionized by the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light, then become trapped by Earth\u2019s magnetic field, making magnetic field lines briefly visible to"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "of the electromagnetic spectrum also invisibly dominate the sky and are stronger than the emissions in the visible spectrum. Many of the spacecraft sent to space are not for exploring the universe, but rather for the practical purpose of GPS, TV, weather predictions, etc. These near-Earth satellites orbit relatively close to Earth and communicate with each other and stations on Earth through the use of lasers. The ionosphere and the ions present there tend to interfere with these signals. Changes in the ions, their density, and localization in the ionosphere will affect how satellites record data and communicate it. But the ionosphere is just invisible air, after all, right? Correct, but airglow is like an indicator to see and observe changes in the ionosphere. Changes in the characteristic photometric spectrum emitted by the ionosphere is how changes in the ionosphere are detected. The composition of the ionosphere is affected by the weather in space, as well as the weather conditions on Earth. The weather on Earth, the intensity of solar radiation, and gravity waves are some of the causes of changes in the ionosphere. Gravity waves are created when there is a disturbance between a fluid medium and gravity or buoyancy tries to restore the fluid to how it originally was or attain equilibrium. The ripples seen in a pond when a stone is dropped in is due to gravity waves. They are different from gravitational waves.

When the time was polled, the MET was incorrectly set eleven hours off. As such, once Starliner had reached space, it continued following its preprogrammed commands from the time it had on board. In this instance, it believed it was eleven hours ahead in the mission and in a different orbit. In trying to maintain this precise orbit, Starliner began to use propellant to correct itself. This issue was confounded by the communication error. Once controllers recognized that the craft was rapidly firing thrusters to maintain the orbit it was not in, there was a delay in communications with the craft, resulting in a missed opportunity to react to the issue and reconfigure the craft to attain the needed orbit to dock.

Orion\u2019s missions only require reentry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at speeds up to 11.2 km/sec, whereas the special IM trajectory would have the spacecraft reentering at speeds near 14.2 km/sec. While this is only a 27% increase in reentry speed, the physics of atmospheric heating produce heat loads that are several times greater. To survive the Orion spacecraft would need a new, thicker, heavier heat shield along with a strict mass limit that is difficult to achieve given the fixed geometry of the Orion crew module.

The Hopper was a FESTIP (Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme) system study design. Hopper was one of several proposals for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) developed by the ESA. The proposed reusable launch vehicles were to be used for the inexpensive delivery of satellite payloads into orbit as early as 2015. A prototype of Hopper, known as (EADS) Phoenix, was a German-led European project which involved the construction and testing of a one-seventh scale model of the proposed Hopper. On 8 May 2004, a single test flight of the Phoenix was conducted at the North European Aerospace Test range in Kiruna, Sweden, which was followed by more tests later that month. Development Background From the 1980s onwards, there was growing international interest in the development of reusable spacecraft; at the time, only the superpowers of the era, the Soviet Union and the United States, had developed this capability. European nations such as the United Kingdom and France embarked on their own national programs to produce spaceplanes, such as HOTOL and Hermes, while attempting to attract the backing of the multinational European Space Agency (ESA). While these programs ultimately did not garner enough support to continue development, there was still demand within a number of the ESA's member states to pursue the development of reusable space vehicles.

The new powerful SuperDraco engine, an advancement of the Draco engines currently used by SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to maneuver on orbit and during reentry, will enable astronauts to eject to safety in the event of an emergency during launch. As part of SpaceX's state-of-the-art launch escape system, eight SuperDraco engines built into the side walls of the Dragon spacecraft will produce up to 120,000 pounds of axial thrust to carry astronauts to safety should an emergency occur during launch. The eight SuperDracos provide redundancy, so that even if one engine fails an escape can still be carried out successfully. The engines can also be restarted multiple times if necessary and they will have the ability to deep throttle, providing astronauts with precise control and enormous power, SpaceX said. In addition, as a part of a recoverable Dragon spacecraft, the engines can be used repeatedly, helping to advance SpaceX's long-term goal of making spacecraft more like airplanes, which can be flown again and again with minimal maintenance between flights, it said.

Communication blackouts with hypersonic vehicles occur because as the craft zips along at five or more times the speed of sound, an envelope of hot ionized air, called a plasma sheath, surrounds it. This plasma sheath will reflect electromagnetic signals under most conditions, cutting off connection with anything outside of the vehicle. However, under certain special conditions, a plasma sheath can actually enhance the radiation from a communication antenna.

When the crew plummeted through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, communications with Mission Control were impossible. During the Apollo era, the radio blackout was a normal part of reentry, caused by ionized air surrounding the CM during its superheated reentry through the atmosphere, which interfered with radio waves. For virtually every reentry from Mercury through Apollo 12, the time of radio blackout was predictable, almost to the second. However, Apollo 13\u2019s radio blackout period was nail-bitingly long: it extended for approximately 87 seconds longer than expected. Five years ago, in a previous \u201c13 Things\u201d series, we discussed possible reasons for why the blackout period was excruciatingly long. The mostly likely explanation was that the spacecraft was coming in on a shallower trajectory than expected. This would result in a longer period in the upper atmosphere where there was less deceleration of the spacecraft. In turn, the reduced pace of deceleration lengthened the time that the heat of reentry produced the ionized gasses that would block communications.

This phenomenon has been known for god knows how long now especially since most spacecraft experience it on reentry to some degree and that is why we have no real time footage of reentries, only perhaps from outside or after it has landed. We have no real way to communicate with our technology through plasma bubbles in any stable manner. Hypersonic missiles experience the same situation that they are coated by a plasma bubble when they fly making communications to the missile almost impossible along with any navigational and guidance systems on the missile itself unable to function properly.

Vehicles flying at hypersonic velocities within the atmosphere become enveloped in a \"plasma sheath\" that prevents radio communication, telemetry, and most importantly, GPS signal reception for navigation. This radio \"blackout\" period has been a problem since the dawn of the manned space program and was an especially significant hindrance during the days of the Apollo missions. An appropriate mitigation method must allow for spacecraft to ground control and ground control to spacecraft communications through the reentry plasma sheath. Many mitigation techniques have been proposed, including but not limited to, aerodynamic shaping, magnetic windows, and liquid injection. The research performed on these mitigation techniques over the years will be reviewed and summarized, along with the advantages and obstacles that each technique will need to overcome to be practically implemented. A unique approach for mitigating the blackout communications problem is presented herein along with research results associated with this method. The novel method involves the injection of ceramic metal-oxide particulate into a simulated reentry plasma to quench the reentry plasma. Injection of the solid ceramic particulates is achieved by entrainment within induced, energetic cathode"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "the radio blackout was a normal part of reentry.

The attenuation increases as the thickness and density of the plasma surrounding the reentry vehicle increases. An illustration of the plasma sheath surrounding a reentry vehicle is given in Figure 1. Regions of lower and higher plasma density near the vehicle are indicated. The associated effects can become so severe that complete loss of voice communications and even GPS acquisition can occur. This RF blackout can last anywhere from 90 s to 10 min depending on the trajectory and velocity of the reentry vehicle [3]. It has had severe consequences, for example, in the unmanned Genesis mission to collect samples of solar winds. During reentry of the capsule, a sensor failure caused a parachute to not deploy. If mission control had been in contact with it, a backup parachute could have been deployed to avoid the capsule from crashing into the Utah desert [4]. Similarly, hypersonic flight has been pursued with both manned and un-manned vehicles since 1961, e.g., with the X-15 hypersonic airplane which flew at Mach 6.7 using only rockets [5].

Flight test objectives were to measure thrust and to examine electromagnetic compatibility with other spacecraft subsystems. The 5-cm-diameter thrusters were designed to operate at 0.02 kW and provide about 89 mN thrust at about 6700 s specific impulse. Thrusters had the capability to operate at 5 setpoints from 18 mN to 89 mN. Thrusters were configured so they could be used for East-West stationkeeping. Prior to launch, a 5-cm cesium thruster was life tested for 2245 hours at the 67 mN thrust level. During the launch process the Centaur stage did not achieve a second burn, and the spacecraft remained attached to the Centaur in a 218 km by 760 km orbit. It was estimated that the pressure at these altitudes was between 1.3 \u00d7 10-4 Pa and 1.3 \u00d7 10-7 Pa.35 Each of the two engines was tested on at least two occasions over the throttling range. Combined test time of the two engines was about 10 hours over a 55 day period. The spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere on October 17, 1968.

The radiation is most intense at the highest altitudes where the air is thinnest, and ionizes the air almost completely. As the radiation is attenuated, its flux diminishes and the density of air increases, further increasing the absorption rate. As such, the majority of deposition of a type and frequency of radiation happens in a single band in the ionosphere, which generates the characteristic banding of the ionosphere. The plasma remains in these bands since they are far outnumbered by the neutral atmosphere at these altitudes, and are very collisional. At higher altitudes where the ionosphere is thinner, the particles co-rotate with the Earth, trapped in flux tubes associated with its magnetic field. Beyond the plasmasphere, electric fields driven by the solar wind dominate over co-rotation, forming the dynamic region known as the magnetosphere. Since the creation of the ionosphere is generally due to the sun, the ionosphere has a strong seasonal, diurnal and solar cycle dependence. A small fraction of the ionosphere is created from cosmic rays impacting the atmosphere, so it is never absent, but it fluctuates greatly with solar activity.

The CINDI observations show that the neutral wind creates piles of neutral gas pushed up against ionospheric density variations - similar to how blowing snow piles up in drifts against a building wall. This results in density striations in the atmosphere that were never previously observed. Such density variations are necessary data to include when modeling interference with radio waves or excess drag on a travelling spacecraft.

These have come from Chinese rockets, North Korean missile launches, and some of SpaceX\u2018s other, more conventional Falcon 9 launches. In the case of Formosat-5 mission, the rocket reached an altitude of 300km after about 5 minutes, and because of its vertical motion, it created not a V-shaped wave but rather giant, circular shock waves, according to a new paper in Space Weather. These circular waves extended over 1.8 million square km, or about four times the area of California, over the western United States and Pacific Ocean region. The scientists say these are the largest circular shockwaves known to have been induced by a rocket launch. A few minutes later, an \u201cionosphere hole,\u201d which appeared 13 minutes after launch, was potentially of more consequence for GPS systems. This occurred when exhaust plumes from the Falcon 9 rocket\u2019s second stage depleted plasma levels across a 900-km wide area, which the scientists say probably caused about a 1-meter error in GPS navigation programs.

Space-weather/Ionosphere modification: \u2018A number of methods have been explored or proposed to modify the ionosphere, including injection of chemical vapors and heating or charging via electromagnetic radiation or particle beams (such as ions, neutral particles, x-rays, MeV particles, and energetic electrons). It is important to note that many techniques to modify the upper atmosphere have been successfully demonstrated experimentally. Ground-based modification techniques employed by the FSU include vertical HF heating, oblique HF heating, microwave heating, and magnetospheric modification. Significant military applications of such operations include low frequency (LF) communication production, HF ducted communications, and creation of an artificial ionosphere. Several high-payoff capabilities that could result from the modification of the ionosphere or near space are described briefly below. It should be emphasized that this list is not comprehensive; modification of the ionosphere is an area rich with potential applications and there are also likely spin-off applications that have yet to be envisioned. Ionospheric mirrors for pinpoint communication or over-the-horizon (OTH) radar transmission. The properties and limitations of the ionosphere as a reflecting medium for high-frequency radiation are described in appendix A. The major disadvantage in depending on the ionosphere to reflect radio waves is its variability, which is due to normal space weather and events such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms. The ionosphere has been described as a crinkled sheet of wax paper whose relative position rises and sinks depending on weather conditions. The surface topography of the crinkled paper also constantly changes,"}, {"title": "pes2o", "text": "The ionospheric density falls off with the rate 1/r because the background neutral atmosphere is constantly ionised at a slow rate, adding plasma to the ionosphere as it expands into space.

The 1/r dependence rather breaks down owing to the acceleration of the ions .

At some point on the front of the comet ionosphere the density must thus drop much faster than 1/r. This may in practice happen because of the polarisation electric field, which has an anti-sunward component such that the initial boundary formation may be self-sustaining. The cloud model predicts a constant electric field inside the cloud. Let us consider the case of a constant uniform electric field E pointing opposite to the neutral gas expansion velocity of a comet. Let us also assume that the neutral gas velocity is negligible compared to the velocity the ions soon acquire through acceleration in the electric field.

Developing the capability to predict such space weather disturbances has been a long-standing goal of the Air Force Research Laboratory. The C/NOFS low altitude observations were critical to form a complete picture of these disturbances, as the satellite ventured to the possible root of the largest ionospheric upheavals -- those that emanate from the bottom ledge of the ionosphere at night.

Earth's ionosphere is a complex and dynamic region of the space environment consisting of a sparse plasma with a reasonably well-known climatology, interspersed with transient structures, depletions and bubbles, and irregularities. Global scale dynamical processes such as solar heating, waves, tides, electric fields, and auroral precipitation drive strong density gradients in the ionosphere. At both low and middle latitudes, plasma irregularities in the ionosphere create fluctuations in electron density and electric fields over a wide range of scale sizes. The larger bubbles and TIDs (Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances) can span hundreds or even thousands of kilometers and can cause errors in differential navigation solutions. The nighttime low-latitude ionosphere is also characterized by smaller-scale bubbles or plumes that are particularly severe at low latitudes under geomagnetically quiet conditions.

The ECHO experiments (Hendrickson et al., 1971) utilized detectors near to the injection location, demonstrating that particles could undergo multiple transitions from hemisphere to hemisphere, maintaining beam stability and detectability. In all, seven ECHO experiments were performed, providing unique insight into the workings of the magnetosphere (Winckler, 1982;Winckler et al., 1989). These earlier experiments injected beams with energies < 40 keV, however advances in accelerator technology now make it feasible for spacecraft to generate beams of electrons with relativistic energies > 0.5 MeV (Banks et al., 1987;Mishin, 2005).

The negative potential is due to an electrostatic barrier near the surface of the spacecraft that can reflect a large fraction of the photoelectron flux back to the spacecraft. This electrostatic barrier forms if (1) the photoelectron density at the surface of the spacecraft greatly exceeds the ambient plasma density, (2) the spacecraft size is significantly larger than local Debye length of the photoelectrons, and (3) the thermal electron energy is much larger than the characteristic energy of the escaping photoelectrons.

For the Earth, the ionosphere extends from 80 km above the ground, where neutrals outnumber ions by over 8 orders of magnitude, to around 1000 km, where ions and neutrals have similar numbers. This region absorbs the majority of EUV and X-rays from the Sun. Energetic particles from the magnetosphere, the solar wind, and the cosmos slam into it. Billions of meteors deposit tons of materials in it, daily. From below, winds and turbulence in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere push it around. All these interactions make the ionosphere complex and interesting. NASA and the space community need accurate models of the ionosphere since the International Space Station and most of our spacecraft exist within it, and can experience harmful radiation and electric charging. The ionosphere was first discovered because of its impact on radio communication and its interference with Earth to Space communications and GPS remain critical issues. This talk will present the basics of ionospheric plasma physics, present a method of simulating ionospheric plasmas, the Particle-in_Cell (PIC) method. It will then show how we used this method to study a number of turbulent processes in the ionosphere and what we have learned from these studies.

Instead, the two planets have similar densities, which differ from Earth's measurements by only a factor of ten. At the same time, the layers affected by the meteoroids on Earth are very narrow, maybe only a mile or two wide, while Venus and Mars both have layers stretching six to eight miles. According to Withers, the difference may come from the presence of Earth's strong magnetic field, a feature lacking on the other two planets. But scientists aren't certain how much of a role the field actually plays. Finding the source To study Earth's ionosphere, scientists can launch rockets to take measurements in the region. But the process is more complicated for other planets.

The field is distinguished from astronomy and astrophysics as well as from earlier attempts to understand our space environment by its capability of measuring in situ the plasmas that surround Earth and pervade the solar system.

The ionosphere, and indeed the Saturn system as a whole, provided a uniquely different environment compared to the terrestrial planets and also Jupiter, with populations of charged dust grains influencing the plasma dynamics. When passing through Saturn\u2019s ionosphere, Cassini observed an ionosphere dominated by ice and dust particles which continually rain inward from Saturn\u2019s vast ring system and soak up free electrons, thus producing a dusty complex plasma. Understanding how incident plasma currents charge a spacecraft relative to its surrounding environment is important for interpreting the surrounding plasma conditions and on-board plasma measurements. In this article, we describe three dimensional Particle-In-Cell simulations of the Cassini spacecraft\u2019s interaction with plasmas representative of Saturn's ionosphere during the Grand Finale. The global simulations revealed complex interaction features such as a highly structured wake containing spacecraft-scale vortices and electron wings, a Langmuir wave analogue of Alfv\u00e9n wings, which propagated at small angles to the magnetic field and upstream into the pristine plasma ahead of Cassini. The results explain how a large negatively charged plasma component combined with a large negative to positive ion mass ratio is able to drive the spacecraft to the observed positive potentials, a previously unexplained phenomenon observed during end-of-mission.

It was proposed that impulses acting on the boundary might lead to a trapping of these waves on the dayside by the ionosphere, resulting in a standing wave or eigenmode of the magnetopause surface. No direct observational evidence of this has been found to date and searches for indirect evidence have proved inconclusive, leading to speculation that this mechanism might not occur. By using fortuitous multipoint spacecraft observations during a rare isolated fast plasma jet impinging on the boundary, here we show that the resulting magnetopause motion and magnetospheric ultra-low frequency waves at well-defined frequencies are in agreement with and can only be explained by the magnetopause surface eigenmode. We therefore show through direct observations that this mechanism, which should impact upon the magnetospheric system globally, does in fact occur. P lanetary magnetic fields act as obstacles to solar/stellar winds with their interaction forming a well-defined region of space known as a magnetosphere. The outer boundary of a magnetosphere, the magnetopause, is arguably the most significant since it controls the flux of mass, energy, and momentum both into and out of the system, with the boundary's motion thus having wide ranging consequences.

These FACs (Field Aligned Currents), or Birkeland currents, couple stresses in the magnetosphere to the ionosphere and drive polar ionospheric dynamics. Although an understanding of the basic configuration of these currents exists, there is little knowledge so far about their variability. In particular, during geomagnetic storms, aurorae and their current systems can expand toward the equator, as seen by ground observatories; a very limited knowledge of these most interesting and important events is available. From a LEO perspective, the Birkeland current signatures are typically hundreds of nT so they are relatively easy to detect with commercial-grade attitude magnetometers. The average configuration of the Birkeland currents was first determined by magnetic field measurements of the TRIAD (Transit- Improved DISCOS) series spacecraft of the US Navy (launch of TRID-1 on Sept. 2, 1972) using data collected over a period of 16 months.

Turbulence in this sea of charged particles can manifest as disruptions that interfere with orbiting satellites or communication and navigation signals used, for example, to guide airplanes, ships and self-driving cars.

GREENBELT, Md. (NASA PR) \u2014 On Oct.10, 2019, NASA launches the Ionospheric Connection Explorer, or ICON, a spacecraft that will explore the dynamic region where Earth meets space: the ionosphere. Overlapping the farthest reaches of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and the very beginning of space, the ionosphere stretches roughly 50 to 400 miles above the surface. Solar radiation cooks tenuous gases there until they lose an electron (or two or three), creating a sea of electrically charged ions and electrons. Neither fully Earth nor space, the ionosphere reacts both to winds and weather from the lower atmosphere below and solar energy streaming in from above, changing constantly to form conditions we call space weather. \u201cAfter years of work, I\u2019m excited to get into orbit and turn on the spacecraft, open the doors on all our instruments,\u201d said Thomas Immel, ICON principal investigator at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cICON carries incredible capacity for science.

In January 2022, as the spacecraft passed over South America, it observed one such earthly disturbance in the ionosphere triggered by the South Pacific volcano. \u201cThese results are an exciting look at how events on Earth can affect weather in space, in addition to space weather affecting Earth,\u201d said Jim Spann, space weather lead for NASA\u2019s Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. \u201cUnderstanding space weather holistically will ultimately help us mitigate its effects on society.\u201d When the volcano erupted, it pushed a giant plume of gases, water vapor, and dust into the sky. The explosion also created large pressure disturbances in the atmosphere, leading to strong winds. As the winds expanded upwards into thinner atmospheric layers, they began moving faster.

The source of these particles would be discovered by Scott Carpenter on the next Mercury flight, but remained a mystery during Glenn's mission. Before his flight ended, however, Glenn would be confronted with a much larger issue than fireflies. Retropack The retropack was a collection of small rockets, called retrorockets, that would fire at the end of a mission to slow the spacecraft, allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere. The pack, which would normally be jettisoned after firing, was attached with straps that stretched across the heatshield. To learn more about the Mercury spacecraft, see: NASA Project Mercury - Spacecraft Telemetry Indicates A Problem As Glenn began his second orbit, telemetry data from Friendship 7 suggested a problem with the spacecraft. A reading from the sensor monitoring the spacecraft's heat shield and landing impact bag indicated that the impact bag had deployed. This could only happen if the heat shield had come loose. If this were the case, Glenn might be incinerated during reentry. Mission Control felt that the reading was most likely caused by a faulty sensor on the spacecraft, and that Glenn's heatshield was fine, but they couldn't be sure. After discussing the issue, they advised Glenn not to jettison his retropack before reentry.

Re-entry and aftermath The mission was considered a great success, both technically and as a public-relations exercise for both nations. The only serious problem was during reentry and splashdown of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic nitrogen tetroxide fumes, caused by the reaction control system (RCS) oxidizer venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and nitrogen tetroxide was sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air.

The spacecraft was designed for both crewed and autonomous uncrewed cargo resupply flights, but was never used operationally in its intended role \u2013 only four test missions were flown (including three that docked to Salyut space stations) during the program. The Functional Cargo Block (FGB) of the TKS spacecraft later formed the basis of several space station modules, including the Zarya FGB module on the International Space Station. The TKS spacecraft consisted of two spacecraft mated together, both of which could operate independently: The VA spacecraft (known mistakenly in the West as the Merkur spacecraft), which would have housed the cosmonauts during launch and reentry of a TKS spacecraft, while traveling to and from an Almaz space station. And the Functional Cargo Block (FGB) which, in order to resupply an Almaz space station, carried docking hardware, tanks, and a large pressurized cargo compartment. Furthermore, the FGB carried the on-orbit maneuvering engines for the TKS. While the VA carried the reentry hardware, and only minimal life support and maneuvering systems, the FGB would have been used as the primary orbital maneuvering system and cargo storage for the TKS spacecraft. The FGB could also be used alone as an uncrewed cargo module without a VA spacecraft, which enabled the FGB design to be re-purposed as FGB space station modules later on.

In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later Salyut space stations had. In connection with this new design, Kliper would feature a launch escape system that would enable it to detach from the carrier rocket if an abort of the mission during orbital ascent is required. An abort would be possible during every phase of the launch with the limitation of the first seconds after launch. Lifting body design On return from space, Kliper's lifting body design would not only allow a smoother descent into Earth's atmosphere than the capsule design, such as Soyuz; but also permit control. RKK Energia claimed that the craft would be able to land in a predetermined one-square-kilometre area. Artistic impressions showed that the Kliper would have resembled a cylinder topped by a cone.

The Thor rocket was the first member of the Delta rocket family of space launch vehicles. The last launch of a direct derivative of the Thor missile occurred in 2018 as the first stage of the final Delta II. Thor-Able Thor was first used as a launch vehicle during the testing program of the warhead reentry vehicle for the Atlas missile. For these three tests a Thor core stage was topped by the Able second stage. Able used the Aerojet AJ-10-40 engine from the Vanguard second stage. The first such launch, 116, was lost on 23 April 1958 due to a turbopump failure in the main engine. The recovery of the reentry vehicles on the succeeding two attempts were not successful. Three mice, one on each vehicle, died in these tests. The Able stage from the Atlas reentry vehicle tests was upgraded to become the Able I with a third stage consisting of an unguided Altair X-248 solid-fuel rocket motor. A Thor Able I was used in an attempt to place the 84 lb (38 kg) Pioneer 0 spacecraft into lunar orbit where it would take pictures of the lunar surface with a TV camera.

Half of the Descent Module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry; this half faces the Earth during reentry. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the Descent Module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere \u2014 as the pioneering Vostok spacecraft's Descent Module used \u2014 but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely ballistic reentry. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn.

On February 1, 2003, I was at home enjoying my retirement, when I received a phone call from my daughter Susan, who worked on the Space Shuttle Program at Johnson Space Center. She said, \"Dad, they've lost contact with Columbia.\" Her words felt like a heavy punch in my gut. Columbia was on reentry coming home from her STS-107 mission. Susan and I both knew that if they had lost contact during reentry, then the vehicle was lost. Only three days earlier, we had marked the seventeenth anniversary of the loss of Challenger. The Space Shuttle Program consumed a major portion of my life. I worked on the shuttle during its development, and I was fortunate enough to be selected to fly with John Young on Columbia during its maiden flight. That first flight was more successful than any of us involved with the program could have hoped for. This was the first time astronauts launched on a vehicle that had not first been tested in an unmanned flight. It was the first crewed vehicle to use solid rocket boosters, and it was the first spacecraft to return to a landing on a runway. John and I were very proud of Columbia's performance on that initial test flight. I flew three more times after my first mission, and I had been preparing to command the initial shuttle flight out of Vandenberg Air Force Base when the Challenger was lost. I became deeply involved with the accident investigation"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "the rest of reentry and recovery were uneventful. The destroyers USS Stormes and USS Compton and a P5M aircraft were waiting for the spacecraft at Station 8, the predicted landing point. Three hours and 13 minutes after launch and nine minutes before splashdown, the aircraft spotted the spacecraft at an altitude of 5,000 feet (1,500 m) descending on its main parachute. The information was relayed to Stormes and Compton, who were 30 miles (48 km) away. The spacecraft recovery aids were all functioning, except for the SARAH beacon. During the descent, the aircraft continued to circle and report landing events. It remained in the area until Stormes arrived, an hour and 15 minutes after the landing. Stormes hauled Enos and his spacecraft aboard. On the deck of Stormes, the MA-5 hatch was blown explosively. It was released from outside the capsule by pulling a lanyard. Blowing the hatch caused the spacecraft \"picture\" window to crack. Mercury spacecraft # 9, used in the Mercury-Atlas 5 mission, on display at the Museum of Life and Science, in Durham, North Carolina. The spacecraft and Enos were both found to have survived the mission in good condition, although the chimp had removed all of the medical electrodes and the urine collection device from his body. On November 4, 1962, Enos died of dysentery caused by shigellosis, which was resistant to antibiotics of the time. He had been under constant observation for two months before his death. Pathologists at Holloman reported that they found no symptom that could be attributed or"}, {"title": "bm25", "text": "Satellite Catalog Number 10979. Following launch, Progress 2 began two days of free flight. It subsequently docked with the aft port of the Salyut 6 space station at 12:58:59 UTC on 9 July. At the time of its docking, Soyuz 29 was docked to the forward port of the station. Soyuz 29 remained docked throughout the time Progress 2 was docked. Mission Progress 2 was the second of twelve Progress spacecraft used to supply the Salyut 6 space station between 1978 and 1981. It delivered cargo to the station, including Kristall a kiln used for experiments aboard the outpost. Progress 2 also transferred of propellant into Salyut 6's tanks. Whilst Progress 2 was docked, Salyut 6 was manned by the EO-2 crew, consisting of cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov. On 29 July 1978, whilst docked to Salyut 6, Progress 2 was catalogued in a low Earth orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of , inclined at 51.66\u00b0 and with a period of 91.1 minutes. Progress 2 undocked from Salyut 6 at 04:57:44 UTC on 2 August. It remained in orbit until the early morning of 4 August 1978, when it was deorbited. The deorbit burn occurred at 01:31:07 UTC, with the spacecraft undergoing a destructive reentry at around 02:15 UTC. Less than four days after Progress 2 had been deorbited, Progress 3 was launched to replace it.
