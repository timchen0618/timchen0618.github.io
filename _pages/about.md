I am a thrid-year PhD student in computer science at **New York University**. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io/). I completed my Master's in Computer Science at UT Austin, and I received B.S. in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. 

My research interest broadly lies in natural language processing and machine learning. More specifically, I am interested in building systems that can understand language and respond to human queries accurately.

## Recent News
- **Jan 2025**: Our paper on [Open-World Evaluation for Retrieving Diverse Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18110) was accepted to NAACL 2025!

## Research Interests
I am interested in finding out what is the most accurate, efficient, and reliable way to gather information and provide answers for user queries. 
- Accurate: I am interested in improving the retrieval quality for various downstream tasks, including retriever tools in DeepResearch agents. How to accurately synthesize information from multiple knowledge sources is also an important problem.
- Efficient: Current search systems often incur multiple calls to find information for a single query. It is possible to reduce the number of calls and maintain performance. 
- Reliable: Retrieval systems should follow instructions reliably, and should generalize to various domains. RAG systems should be robust to irrelevant information, and how the information is presented.
